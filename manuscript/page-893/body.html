<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have you seen that long?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I began to be aware of it before, but was only perfectly sure of it the day before yesterday, almost at the moment I arrived in Petersburg. I still fancied in Moscow, though, that I was coming to try to get Avdotya Romanovna&rsquo;s hand and to cut out Mr. Luzhin.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excuse me for interrupting you; kindly be brief, and come to the object of your visit. I am in a hurry, I want to go out...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;With the greatest pleasure. On arriving here and determining on a certain... journey, I should like to make some necessary preliminary arrangements. I left my children with an aunt; they are well provided for; and they have no need of me personally. And a nice father I should make, too! I have taken nothing but what Marfa Petrovna gave me a year ago. That&rsquo;s enough for me.</p></div> </div>
