My goodness, why am I sitting here?&rdquo; she cried, jumping up. &ldquo;There is coffee and I don&rsquo;t offer you any. Ah, that&rsquo;s the selfishness of old age. I&rsquo;ll get it at once!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Mother, don&rsquo;t trouble, I am going at once. I haven&rsquo;t come for that. Please listen to me.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulcheria Alexandrovna went up to him timidly.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother, whatever happens, whatever you hear about me, whatever you are told about me, will you always love me as you do now?&rdquo; he asked suddenly from the fullness of his heart, as though not thinking of his words and not weighing them.</p></div> </div>
