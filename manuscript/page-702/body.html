I interrupted you!&rdquo; Razumihin cried hastily.</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Raskolnikov seemed to wake up. &ldquo;Oh... I got spattered with blood helping to carry him to his lodging. By the way, mamma, I did an unpardonable thing yesterday. I was literally out of my mind. I gave away all the money you sent me... to his wife for the funeral. She&rsquo;s a widow now, in consumption, a poor creature... three little children, starving... nothing in the house... there&rsquo;s a daughter, too... perhaps you&rsquo;d have given it yourself if you&rsquo;d seen them. But I had no right to do it I admit, especially as I knew how you needed the money yourself. To help others one must have the right to do it, or else Crevez, chiens, si vous n&rsquo;Ãªtes pas contents.&rdquo; He laughed, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, isn&rsquo;t it, Dounia?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
