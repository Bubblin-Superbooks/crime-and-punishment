How did you find me, by the way?&rdquo; he added, as though he wanted to say something quite different. He wanted to look at her soft clear eyes, but this was not easy.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you gave your address to Polenka yesterday.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Polenka? Oh, yes; Polenka, that is the little girl. She is your sister? Did I give her the address?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, had you forgotten?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I remember.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I had heard my father speak of you... only I did not know your name, and he did not know it.
