<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Granted that he &lsquo;let it slip,&rsquo; though he is a sensible man, (yet maybe it was not a slip at all, but he meant to make himself clear as soon as possible) but Dounia, Dounia? She understands the man, of course, but she will have to live with the man. Why! she&rsquo;d live on black bread and water, she would not sell her soul, she would not barter her moral freedom for comfort; she would not barter it for all Schleswig-Holstein, much less Mr. Luzhin&rsquo;s money. No, Dounia was not that sort when I knew her and... she is still the same, of course! Yes, there&rsquo;s no denying, the Svidriga√Ølovs are a bitter pill! It&rsquo;s a bitter thing to spend one&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
