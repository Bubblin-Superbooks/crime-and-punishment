He stopped there while the porter and others were going upstairs, waited till they were out of hearing, and then went calmly downstairs at the very minute when Dmitri and Nikolay ran out into the street and there was no one in the entry; possibly he was seen, but not noticed. There are lots of people going in and out. He must have dropped the ear-rings out of his pocket when he stood behind the door, and did not notice he dropped them, because he had other things to think of. The jewel-case is a conclusive proof that he did stand there.... That&rsquo;s how I explain it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Too clever! No, my boy, you&rsquo;re too clever. That beats everything.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But, why, why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, because everything fits too well... it&rsquo;s too melodramatic.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
