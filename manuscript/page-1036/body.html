<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> you mentioned inquiries yourself just now... I assure you these interrogations are sometimes more embarrassing for the interrogator than for the interrogated.... You made the observation yourself just now very aptly and wittily.&rdquo; (Raskolnikov had made no observation of the kind.) &ldquo;One gets into a muddle! A regular muddle! One keeps harping on the same note, like a drum! There is to be a reform and we shall be called by a different name, at least, he-he-he! And as for our legal tradition, as you so wittily called it, I thoroughly agree with you. Every prisoner on trial, even the rudest peasant, knows that they begin by disarming him with irrelevant questions (as you so happily put it) and then deal him a knock-down blow, he-he-he!&mdash;your felicitous comparison, he-he! So you really imagined that I meant by &lsquo;government quarters&rsquo;... he-he! You are an ironical person. Come.</p></div> </div>
