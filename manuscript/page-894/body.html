<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Excuse me, I am just coming to the point. Before the journey which may come off, I want to settle Mr. Luzhin, too. It&rsquo;s not that I detest him so much, but it was through him I quarrelled with Marfa Petrovna when I learned that she had dished up this marriage. I want now to see Avdotya Romanovna through your mediation, and if you like in your presence, to explain to her that in the first place she will never gain anything but harm from Mr. Luzhin. Then, begging her pardon for all past unpleasantness, to make her a present of ten thousand roubles and so assist the rupture with Mr. Luzhin, a rupture to which I believe she is herself not disinclined, if she could see the way to it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are certainly mad,&rdquo; cried Raskolnikov not so much angered as astonished. &ldquo;How dare you talk like that!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
