<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Is not that so? Do you understand what that smartness means? Do you understand that the Luzhin smartness is just the same thing as Sonia&rsquo;s and may be worse, viler, baser, because in your case, Dounia, it&rsquo;s a bargain for luxuries, after all, but with Sonia it&rsquo;s simply a question of starvation. It has to be paid for, it has to be paid for, Dounia, this smartness. And what if it&rsquo;s more than you can bear afterwards, if you regret it? The bitterness, the misery, the curses, the tears hidden from all the world, for you are not a Marfa Petrovna. And how will your mother feel then? Even now she is uneasy, she is worried, but then, when she sees it all clearly? And I? Yes, indeed, what have you taken me for? I won&rsquo;t have your sacrifice, Dounia, I won&rsquo;t have it, mother! It shall not be, so long as I am alive, it shall not, it shall not! I won&rsquo;t accept it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
