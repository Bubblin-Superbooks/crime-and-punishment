But have you noticed, he takes no interest in anything, he does not respond to anything except one point on which he seems excited&mdash;that&rsquo;s the murder?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; Razumihin agreed, &ldquo;I noticed that, too. He is interested, frightened. It gave him a shock on the day he was ill in the police office; he fainted.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Tell me more about that this evening and I&rsquo;ll tell you something afterwards. He interests me very much! In half an hour I&rsquo;ll go and see him again.... There&rsquo;ll be no inflammation though.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
