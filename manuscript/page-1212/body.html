<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>When Lebeziatnikov finished his long-winded harangue with the logical deduction at the end, he was quite tired, and the perspiration streamed from his face. He could not, alas, even express himself correctly in Russian, though he knew no other language, so that he was quite exhausted, almost emaciated after this heroic exploit.

Pyotr Petrovitch felt that things were going badly with him.</p><p>&ldquo;What is it to do with me if silly ideas did occur to you?&rdquo; he shouted, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s no evidence.

You are lying and slandering from some spite against me, simply from pique, because I did not agree with your free-thinking, godless, social propositions!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
