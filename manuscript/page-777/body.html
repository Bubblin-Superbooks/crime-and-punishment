Why, Rodya, this morning we had only three roubles in our pocket and Dounia and I were just planning to pawn her watch, so as to avoid borrowing from that man until he offered help.&rdquo;</p><p>Dounia seemed strangely impressed by Svidriga√Ølov&rsquo;s offer. She still stood meditating.</p><p>&ldquo;He has got some terrible plan,&rdquo; she said in a half whisper to herself, almost shuddering.</p><p>Raskolnikov noticed this disproportionate terror.</p><p>&ldquo;I fancy I shall have to see him more than once again,&rdquo; he said to Dounia.</p><p>&ldquo;We will watch him! I will track him out!&rdquo; cried Razumihin, vigorously. &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t lose sight of him. Rodya has given me leave. He said to me himself just now. &lsquo;Take care of my sister.&rsquo; Will you give me leave, too, Avdotya Romanovna?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
