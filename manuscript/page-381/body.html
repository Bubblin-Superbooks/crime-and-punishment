And at the request of your mamma, who has sent you a remittance once before in the same manner through him, he did not refuse this time also, and sent instructions to Semyon Semyonovitch some days since to hand you thirty-five roubles in the hope of better to come.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That &lsquo;hoping for better to come&rsquo; is the best thing you&rsquo;ve said, though &lsquo;your mamma&rsquo; is not bad either.
