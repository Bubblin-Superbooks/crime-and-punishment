<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> She came in very smart in a new green silk dress with a long train. &lsquo;Good day, Arkady Ivanovitch! How do you like my dress? Aniska can&rsquo;t make like this.&rsquo; (Aniska was a dressmaker in the country, one of our former serf girls who had been trained in Moscow, a pretty wench.) She stood turning round before me. I looked at the dress, and then I looked carefully, very carefully, at her face. &lsquo;I wonder you trouble to come to me about such trifles, Marfa Petrovna.&rsquo; &lsquo;Good gracious, you won&rsquo;t let one disturb you about anything!&rsquo; To tease her I said, &lsquo;I want to get married, Marfa Petrovna.&rsquo; &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just like you, Arkady Ivanovitch; it does you very little credit to come looking for a bride when you&rsquo;ve hardly buried your wife.</p></div> </div>
