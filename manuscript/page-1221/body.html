Don&rsquo;t squeeze, let me pass!&rdquo; he said, making his way through the crowd. &ldquo;And no threats, if you please! I assure you it will be useless, you will gain nothing by it. On the contrary, you&rsquo;ll have to answer, gentlemen, for violently obstructing the course of justice. The thief has been more than unmasked, and I shall prosecute. Our judges are not so blind and... not so drunk, and will not believe the testimony of two notorious infidels, agitators, and atheists, who accuse me from motives of personal revenge which they are foolish enough to admit.... Yes, allow me to pass!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me find a trace of you in my room! Kindly leave at once, and everything is at an end between us! When I think of the trouble I&rsquo;ve been taking, the way I&rsquo;ve been expounding... all this fortnight!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
