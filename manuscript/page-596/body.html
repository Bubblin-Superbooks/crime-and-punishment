<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Raskolnikov stopped in the entry, where two of the landlady&rsquo;s servants were busy behind a screen with two samovars, bottles, plates and dishes of pie and savouries, brought up from the landlady&rsquo;s kitchen. Raskolnikov sent in for Razumihin. He ran out delighted. At the first glance it was apparent that he had had a great deal to drink and, though no amount of liquor made Razumihin quite drunk, this time he was perceptibly affected by it.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; Raskolnikov hastened to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only just come to tell you you&rsquo;ve won your bet and that no one really knows what may not happen to him. I can&rsquo;t come in; I am so weak that I shall fall down directly. And so good evening and good-bye! Come and see me to-morrow.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
