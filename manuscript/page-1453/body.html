<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The day after we&rsquo;d been betrothed, I bought her presents to the value of fifteen hundred roubles&mdash;a set of diamonds and another of pearls and a silver dressing-case as large as this, with all sorts of things in it, so that even my Madonna&rsquo;s face glowed. I sat her on my knee, yesterday, and I suppose rather too unceremoniously&mdash;she flushed crimson and the tears started, but she didn&rsquo;t want to show it. We were left alone, she suddenly flung herself on my neck (for the first time of her own accord), put her little arms round me, kissed me, and vowed that she would be an obedient, faithful, and good wife, would make me happy, would devote all her life, every minute of her life, would sacrifice everything, everything, and that all she asks in return is my respect, and that she wants &lsquo;nothing, nothing more from me, no presents.</p></div> </div>
