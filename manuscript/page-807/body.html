<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It&rsquo;s only in that sense I speak of their right to crime in my article (you remember it began with the legal question). There&rsquo;s no need for such anxiety, however; the masses will scarcely ever admit this right, they punish them or hang them (more or less), and in doing so fulfil quite justly their conservative vocation. But the same masses set these criminals on a pedestal in the next generation and worship them (more or less). The first category is always the man of the present, the second the man of the future. The first preserve the world and people it, the second move the world and lead it to its goal. Each class has an equal right to exist. In fact, all have equal rights with me&mdash;and vive la guerre éternelle&mdash;till the New Jerusalem, of course!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
