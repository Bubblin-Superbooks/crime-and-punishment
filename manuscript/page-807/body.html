Ah, why did you say that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he added almost solemnly, &ldquo;and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself <em>for nothing</em>.

Tell me,&rdquo; he went on almost in a frenzy, &ldquo;how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;But what would become of them?&rdquo; Sonia asked</p></div> </div>
