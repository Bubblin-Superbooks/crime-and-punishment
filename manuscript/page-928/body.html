<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">say something to her yesterday of the possibility of a pension? Because she told me you had undertaken to get her one. Was that true?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not in the slightest, and indeed it&rsquo;s an absurdity! I merely hinted at her obtaining temporary assistance as the widow of an official who had died in the service&mdash;if only she has patronage... but apparently your late parent had not served his full term and had not indeed been in the service at all of late.

A go-ahead lady!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, she is. For she is credulous and good-hearted, and she believes everything from the goodness of her heart and... and... and she is like that... yes...
