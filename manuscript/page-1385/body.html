<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, don&rsquo;t put too much faith in words, perhaps prison will not be altogether a restful place. That&rsquo;s only theory and my theory, and what authority am I for you? Perhaps, too, even now I am hiding something from you? I can&rsquo;t lay bare everything, he-he! And how can you ask what advantage? Don&rsquo;t you know how it would lessen your sentence? You would be confessing at a moment when another man has taken the crime on himself and so has muddled the whole case. Consider that! I swear before God that I will so arrange that your confession shall come as a complete surprise. We will make a clean sweep of all these psychological points, of a suspicion against you, so that your crime will appear to have been something like an aberration, for in truth it was an aberration. I am an honest man, Rodion Romanovitch, and will keep my word.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
