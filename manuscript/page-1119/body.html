Eh?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not insult, but protest. I should do it with a good object. I might indirectly assist the cause of enlightenment and propaganda. It&rsquo;s a duty of every man to work for enlightenment and propaganda and the more harshly, perhaps, the better. I might drop a seed, an idea.... And something might grow up from that seed. How should I be insulting them? They might be offended at first, but afterwards they&rsquo;d see I&rsquo;d done them a service.</p></div> </div>
