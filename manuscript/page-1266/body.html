<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">ways here and truly I see for myself that they are better. I&rsquo;ve made up my mind once for all: how could I understand your plans and expect you to give an account of them? God knows what concerns and plans you may have, or what ideas you are hatching; so it&rsquo;s not for me to keep nudging your elbow, asking you what you are thinking about? But, my goodness! why am I running to and fro as though I were crazy...? I am reading your article in the magazine for the third time, Rodya. Dmitri Prokofitch brought it to me. Directly I saw it I cried out to myself: &lsquo;There, foolish one,&rsquo; I thought, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s what he is busy about; that&rsquo;s the solution of the mystery! Learned people are always like that. He may have some new ideas in his head just now; he is thinking them over and I worry him and upset him.&rsquo; I read it, my dear, and of course there was a great deal I did not understand; but that&rsquo;s only natural&mdash;how should I?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
