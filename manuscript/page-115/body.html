Indeed, dear Rodya, the letter was so nobly and touchingly written that I sobbed when I read it and to this day I cannot read it without tears. Moreover, the evidence of the servants, too, cleared Dounia&rsquo;s reputation; they had seen and known a great deal more than Mr. Svidriga√Ølov had himself supposed&mdash;as indeed is always the case with servants. Marfa Petrovna was completely taken aback, and &lsquo;again crushed&rsquo; as she said herself to us, but she was completely convinced of Dounia&rsquo;s innocence.</p></div> </div>
