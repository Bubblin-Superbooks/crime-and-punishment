<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Without stopping to think, Raskolnikov went down the steps at once. Till that moment he had never been into a tavern, but now he felt giddy and was tormented by a burning thirst. He longed for a drink of cold beer, and attributed his sudden weakness to the want of food. He sat down at a sticky little table in a dark and dirty corner; ordered some beer, and eagerly drank off the first glassful. At once he felt easier; and his thoughts became clear.</p><p>&ldquo;All that&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; he said hopefully, &ldquo;and there is nothing in it all to worry about! It&rsquo;s simply physical derangement. Just a glass of beer, a piece of dry bread&mdash;and in one moment the brain is stronger, the mind is clearer and the will is firm! Phew, how utterly petty it all is!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
