<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Suddenly someone sat down beside him at his table. He looked up, it was the head clerk Zametov, looking just the same, with the rings on his fingers and the watch-chain, with the curly, black hair, parted and pomaded, with the smart waistcoat, rather shabby coat and doubtful linen. He was in a good humour, at least he was smiling very gaily and good-humouredly. His dark face was rather flushed from the champagne he had drunk.</p><p>&ldquo;What, you here?&rdquo; he began in surprise, speaking as though he&rsquo;d known him all his life. &ldquo;Why, Razumihin told me only yesterday you were unconscious. How strange! And do you know I&rsquo;ve been to see you?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
