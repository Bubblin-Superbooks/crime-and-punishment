<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Svidriga√Ølov sat lost in thought.</p><p>&ldquo;And what if there are only spiders there, or something of that sort,&rdquo; he said suddenly.</p><p>&ldquo;He is a madman,&rdquo; thought Raskolnikov.</p><p>&ldquo;We always imagine eternity as something beyond our conception, something vast, vast! But why must it be vast? Instead of all that, what if it&rsquo;s one little room, like a bath house in the country, black and grimy and spiders in every corner, and that&rsquo;s all eternity is? I sometimes fancy it like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Can it be you can imagine nothing juster and more comforting than that?&rdquo; Raskolnikov cried, with a feeling of anguish.</p></div> </div>
