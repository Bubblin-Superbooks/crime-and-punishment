Koch began to be restless.</p><p>&ldquo;What the devil?&rdquo; he cried suddenly and in impatience deserting his sentry duty, he, too, went down, hurrying and thumping with his heavy boots on the stairs. The steps died away.</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens! What am I to do?&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov unfastened the hook, opened the door&mdash;there was no sound. Abruptly, without any thought at all, he went out, closing the door as thoroughly as he could, and went downstairs.</p><p>He had gone down three flights when he suddenly heard a loud voice below&mdash;where could he go! There was nowhere to hide. He was just going back to the flat.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey there! Catch the brute!&rdquo;</p><p>Somebody dashed out of a flat below, shouting, and rather fell than ran down the stairs, bawling at the top of his voice.</p></div> </div>
