I saw her first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you awake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door&mdash;always at the door. I can almost hear her.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What made me think that something of the sort must be happening to you?&rdquo; Raskolnikov said suddenly.</p><p>At the same moment he was surprised at having said it. He was much excited.</p></div> </div>
