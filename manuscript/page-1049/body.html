<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>am speaking seriously, Rodion Romanovitch&rdquo; (as he said this Porfiry Petrovitch, who was scarcely five-and-thirty, actually seemed to have grown old; even his voice changed and he seemed to shrink together) &ldquo;Moreover, I&rsquo;m a candid man... am I a candid man or not? What do you say? I fancy I really am: I tell you these things for nothing and don&rsquo;t even expect a reward for it, he-he! Well, to proceed, wit in my opinion is a splendid thing, it is, so to say, an adornment of nature and a consolation of life, and what tricks it can play! So that it sometimes is hard for a poor examining lawyer to know where he is, especially when he&rsquo;s liable to be carried away by his own fancy, too, for you know he is a man after all! But the poor fellow is saved by the criminal&rsquo;s temperament, worse luck for him! But young people carried away by their own wit don&rsquo;t think of that &lsquo;</p></div> </div>
