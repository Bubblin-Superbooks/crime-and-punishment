<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Heruvimov is going to bring out this work as a contribution to the woman question; I am translating it; he will expand these two and a half signatures into six, we shall make up a gorgeous title half a page long and bring it out at half a rouble. It will do! He pays me six roubles the signature, it works out to about fifteen roubles for the job, and I&rsquo;ve had six already in advance. When we have finished this, we are going to begin a translation about whales, and then some of the dullest scandals out of the second part of Les Confessions we have marked for translation; somebody has told Heruvimov, that Rousseau was a kind of Radishchev. You may be sure I don&rsquo;t contradict him, hang him! Well, would you like to do the second signature of &lsquo;Is woman a human being?&rsquo; If you would, take the German and pens and paper&mdash;all those are provided, and take three roubles;</p></div> </div>
