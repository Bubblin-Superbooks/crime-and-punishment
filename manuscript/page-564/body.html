She instantly placed under the luckless man&rsquo;s head a pillow, which no one had thought of and began undressing and examining him. She kept her head, forgetting herself, biting her trembling lips and stifling the screams which were ready to break from her.</p><p>Raskolnikov meanwhile induced someone to run for a doctor. There was a doctor, it appeared, next door but one.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent for a doctor,&rdquo; he kept assuring Katerina Ivanovna, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be uneasy, I&rsquo;ll pay. Haven&rsquo;t you water?... and give me a napkin or a towel, anything, as quick as you can.... He is injured, but not killed, believe me.... We shall see what the doctor says!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
