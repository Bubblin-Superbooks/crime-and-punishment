<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;... But I should like to know why mother has written to me about &lsquo;our most rising generation&rsquo;? Simply as a descriptive touch, or with the idea of prepossessing me in favour of Mr. Luzhin? Oh, the cunning of them! I should like to know one thing more: how far they were open with one another that day and night and all this time since? Was it all put into words, or did both understand that they had the same thing at heart and in their minds, so that there was no need to speak of it aloud, and better not to speak of it. Most likely it was partly like that, from mother&rsquo;s letter it&rsquo;s evident: he struck her as rude a little, and mother in her simplicity took her observations to Dounia. And she was sure to be vexed and &lsquo;answered her angrily.</p></div> </div>
