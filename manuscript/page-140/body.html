<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The chief thing is he is &lsquo;a man of business and seems kind,&rsquo; that was something, wasn&rsquo;t it, to send the bags and big box for them! A kind man, no doubt after that! But his bride and her mother are to drive in a peasant&rsquo;s cart covered with sacking (I know, I have been driven in it). No matter! It is only ninety versts and then they can &lsquo;travel very comfortably, third class,&rsquo; for a thousand versts! Quite right, too. One must cut one&rsquo;s coat according to one&rsquo;s cloth, but what about you, Mr. Luzhin? She is your bride.... And you must be aware that her mother has to raise money on her pension for the journey. To be sure it&rsquo;s a matter of business, a partnership for mutual benefit, with equal shares and expenses;&mdash;food and drink provided, but pay for your tobacco. The business man has got the better of them, too.</p></div> </div>
