<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You get a splendid profit on some books nowadays! And the great point of the business is that we shall know just what wants translating, and we shall be translating, publishing, learning all at once. I can be of use because I have experience. For nearly two years I&rsquo;ve been scuttling about among the publishers, and now I know every detail of their business. You need not be a saint to make pots, believe me! And why, why should we let our chance slip! Why, I know&mdash;and I kept the secret&mdash;two or three books which one might get a hundred roubles simply for thinking of translating and publishing. Indeed, and I would not take five hundred for the very idea of one of them. And what do you think? If I were to tell a publisher, I dare say he&rsquo;d hesitate&mdash;they are such blockheads! And as for the business side, printing, paper, selling, you trust to me, I know my way about.</p></div> </div>
