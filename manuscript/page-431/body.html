<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> &lsquo;The day before yesterday, just after eight o&rsquo;clock&rsquo;&mdash;mark the day and the hour!&mdash;&lsquo;a journeyman house-painter, Nikolay, who had been in to see me already that day, brought me this box of gold ear-rings and stones, and asked me to give him two roubles for them. When I asked him where he got them, he said that he picked them up in the street. I did not ask him anything more.&rsquo; I am telling you Dushkin&rsquo;s story. &lsquo;I gave him a note&rsquo;&mdash;a rouble that is&mdash;&lsquo;for I thought if he did not pawn it with me he would with another. It would all come to the same thing&mdash;he&rsquo;d spend it on drink, so the thing had better be with me. The further you hide it the quicker you will find it, and if anything turns up, if I hear any rumours, I&rsquo;ll take it to the police.</p></div> </div>
