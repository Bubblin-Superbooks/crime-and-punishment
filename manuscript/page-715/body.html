And do you remember, mother, I was in love and wanted to get married?&rdquo; he said suddenly, looking at his mother, who was disconcerted by the sudden change of subject and the way he spoke of it.</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, my dear.&rdquo;</p><p>Pulcheria Alexandrovna exchanged glances with Dounia and Razumihin.</p><p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m, yes.
