This does not hurt me, but is a positive con-so-la-tion, ho-nou-red sir,&rdquo; he called out, shaken to and fro by his hair and even once striking the ground with his forehead. The child asleep on the floor woke up, and began to cry. The boy in the corner losing all control began trembling and screaming and rushed to his sister in violent terror, almost in a fit. The eldest girl was shaking like a leaf.</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s drunk it! he&rsquo;s drunk it all,&rdquo; the poor woman screamed in despair&mdash;&ldquo;and his clothes are gone! And they are hungry, hungry!&rdquo;&mdash;and wringing her hands she pointed to the children. &ldquo;Oh, accursed life! And you, are you not ashamed?&rdquo;&mdash;she pounced all at once upon Raskolnikov&mdash;&ldquo;from the tavern! Have you been drinking with him? You have been drinking with him, too! Go away!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
