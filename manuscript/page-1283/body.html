One may well believe it.... How it is she wasn&rsquo;t taken up, I can&rsquo;t understand! Now she is telling everyone, including Amalia Ivanovna; but it&rsquo;s difficult to understand her, she is screaming and flinging herself about.... Oh yes, she shouts that since everyone has abandoned her, she will take the children and go into the street with a barrel-organ, and the children will sing and dance, and she too, and collect money, and will go every day under the general&rsquo;s window... &lsquo;to let everyone see well-born children, whose father was an official, begging in the street.&rsquo; She keeps beating the children and they are all crying. She is teaching Lida to sing &lsquo;My Village,&rsquo; the boy to dance, Polenka the same.</p></div> </div>
