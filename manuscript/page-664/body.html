And the unconcealed, persistent, nervous, and <em>discourteous</em> sarcasm of Porfiry seemed strange to Razumihin beside that quiet and mournful face.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, brother, if you are really serious... You are right, of course, in saying that it&rsquo;s not new, that it&rsquo;s like what we&rsquo;ve read and heard a thousand times already; but what is really original in all this, and is exclusively your own, to my horror, is that you sanction bloodshed <em>in the name of conscience</em>, and, excuse my saying so, with such fanaticism.... That, I take it, is the point of your article. But that sanction of bloodshed <em>by conscience</em> is to my mind... more terrible than the official, legal sanction of bloodshed....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are quite right, it is more terrible,&rdquo; Porfiry agreed.</p></div> </div>
