And I expect I shan&rsquo;t sleep all night... Zossimov was afraid a little time ago that he would go mad... that&rsquo;s why he mustn&rsquo;t be irritated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; cried the mother.</p><p>&ldquo;Did the doctor really say that?&rdquo; asked Avdotya Romanovna, alarmed.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, but it&rsquo;s not so, not a bit of it. He gave him some medicine, a powder, I saw it, and then your coming here.... Ah! It would have been better if you had come to-morrow. It&rsquo;s a good thing we went away. And in an hour Zossimov himself will report to you about everything. He is not drunk! And I shan&rsquo;t be drunk....</p></div> </div>
