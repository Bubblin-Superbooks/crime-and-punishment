Darkness came over me,&rdquo; he added suddenly, and was again silent.</p><p>He still remained on his knees. Porfiry Petrovitch stood for some moments as though meditating, but suddenly roused himself and waved back the uninvited spectators. They instantly vanished and closed the door. Then he looked towards Raskolnikov, who was standing in the corner, staring wildly at Nikolay and moved towards him, but stopped short, looked from Nikolay to Raskolnikov and then again at Nikolay, and seeming unable to restrain himself darted at the latter.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re in too great a hurry,&rdquo; he shouted at him, almost angrily. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask you what came over you.... Speak, did you kill them?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am the murderer.... I want to give evidence,&rdquo; Nikolay pronounced.</p></div> </div>
