Isn&rsquo;t it so?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Excited? Not a bit of it,&rdquo; said Razumihin, stung to the quick.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, brother, I assure you it&rsquo;s noticeable. Why, you sat on your chair in a way you never do sit, on the edge somehow, and you seemed to be writhing all the time. You kept jumping up for nothing. One moment you were angry, and the next your face looked like a sweetmeat. You even blushed; especially when you were invited to dinner, you blushed awfully.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
