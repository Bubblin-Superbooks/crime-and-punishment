How could I have given it to her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I saw it, I saw it,&rdquo; Lebeziatnikov repeated, &ldquo;and though it is against my principles, I am ready this very minute to take any oath you like before the court, for I saw how you slipped it in her pocket. Only like a fool I thought you did it out of kindness! When you were saying good-bye to her at the door, while you held her hand in one hand, with the other, the left, you slipped the note into her pocket. I saw it, I saw it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
