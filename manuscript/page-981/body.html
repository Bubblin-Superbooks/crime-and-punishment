And I said, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t stay,&rsquo; as I didn&rsquo;t want to read, and I&rsquo;d gone in chiefly to show Katerina Ivanovna some collars. Lizaveta, the pedlar, sold me some collars and cuffs cheap, pretty, new, embroidered ones. Katerina Ivanovna liked them very much; she put them on and looked at herself in the glass and was delighted with them. &lsquo;Make me a present of them, Sonia,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;please do.&rsquo; &lsquo;Please do,&rsquo; she said, she wanted them so much.</p></div> </div>
