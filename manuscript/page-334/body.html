They state themselves that they knocked and the door was locked; yet three minutes later when they went up with the porter, it turned out the door was unfastened.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it; the murderer must have been there and bolted himself in; and they&rsquo;d have caught him for a certainty if Koch had not been an ass and gone to look for the porter too.
