<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Your son intentionally exaggerated the significance of my words and made them ridiculous, accusing me of malicious intentions, and, as far as I could see, relied upon your correspondence with him. I shall consider myself happy, Pulcheria Alexandrovna, if it is possible for you to convince me of an opposite conclusion, and thereby considerately reassure me. Kindly let me know in what terms precisely you repeated my words in your letter to Rodion Romanovitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; faltered Pulcheria Alexandrovna. &ldquo;I repeated them as I understood them. I don&rsquo;t know how Rodya repeated them to you, perhaps he exaggerated.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He could not have exaggerated them, except at your instigation.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
