Porfiry seemed to guess his state of mind.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to have it out with you, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! I owe you an explanation and must give it to you,&rdquo; he continued with a slight smile, just patting Raskolnikov&rsquo;s knee.</p><p>But almost at the same instant a serious and careworn look came into his face; to his surprise Raskolnikov saw a touch of sadness in it. He had never seen and never suspected such an expression in his face.</p><p>&ldquo;A strange scene passed between us last time we met, Rodion Romanovitch. Our first interview, too, was a strange one; but then... and one thing after another! This is the point: I have perhaps acted unfairly to you; I feel it. Do you remember how we parted? Your nerves were unhinged and your knees were shaking and so were mine.</p></div> </div>
