<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a child, Sonia,&rdquo; he said softly. &ldquo;What wrong have I done them? Why should I go to them? What should I say to them? That&rsquo;s only a phantom.... They destroy men by millions themselves and look on it as a virtue. They are knaves and scoundrels, Sonia! I am not going to them. And what should I say to them&mdash;that I murdered her, but did not dare to take the money and hid it under a stone?&rdquo; he added with a bitter smile. &ldquo;Why, they would laugh at me, and would call me a fool for not getting it. A coward and a fool! They wouldn&rsquo;t understand and they don&rsquo;t deserve to understand. Why should I go to them? I won&rsquo;t. Don&rsquo;t be a child, Sonia....&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
