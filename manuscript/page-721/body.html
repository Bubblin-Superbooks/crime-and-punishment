He may, of course, think too well of himself, but I hope he esteems me, too.... Why are you laughing again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why are you blushing again? You are lying, sister. You are intentionally lying, simply from feminine obstinacy, simply to hold your own against me.... You cannot respect Luzhin. I have seen him and talked with him. So you are selling yourself for money, and so in any case you are acting basely, and I am glad at least that you can blush for it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is not true. I am not lying,&rdquo; cried Dounia, losing her composure. &ldquo;I would not marry him if I were not convinced that he esteems me and thinks highly of me. I would not marry him if I were not firmly convinced that I can respect him.</p></div> </div>
