<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Very much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Very much!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;All right then. This is how I should behave,&rdquo; Raskolnikov began, again bringing his face close to Zametov&rsquo;s, again staring at him and speaking in a whisper, so that the latter positively shuddered. &ldquo;This is what I should have done. I should have taken the money and jewels, I should have walked out of there and have gone straight to some deserted place with fences round it and scarcely anyone to be seen, some kitchen garden or place of that sort. I should have looked out beforehand some stone weighing a hundredweight or more which had been lying in the corner from the time the house was built. I would lift that stone&mdash;there would sure to be a hollow under it, and I would put the jewels and money in that hole. Then I&rsquo;d roll the stone back so that it would look as before, would press it down with my foot and walk away.</p></div> </div>
