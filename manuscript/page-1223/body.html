Do you remember that moonlight night, when the nightingale was singing?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; there was a flash of fury in Dounia&rsquo;s eyes, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a lie and a libel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A lie?

Well, shoot away!&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">Dounia raised the revolver, and deadly pale, gazed at him, measuring the distance and awaiting the first movement on his part.
