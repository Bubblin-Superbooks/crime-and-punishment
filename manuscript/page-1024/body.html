<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">smile. &ldquo;Ach, what silly stuff I am talking, eh?&rdquo;</p><p>The thought flashed through Sonia&rsquo;s mind, wasn&rsquo;t he mad? But she dismissed it at once. &ldquo;No, it was something else.&rdquo; She could make nothing of it, nothing.</p><p>&ldquo;Do you know, Sonia,&rdquo; he said suddenly with conviction, &ldquo;let me tell you: if I&rsquo;d simply killed because I was hungry,&rdquo; laying stress on every word and looking enigmatically but sincerely at her, &ldquo;I should be <em>happy</em> now. You must believe that! What would it matter to you,&rdquo; he cried a moment later with a sort of despair, &ldquo;what would it matter to you if I were to confess that I did wrong? What do you gain by such a stupid triumph over me? Ah, Sonia, was it for that I&rsquo;ve come to you to-day?&rdquo;</p><p>Again Sonia tried to say something, but did not speak.</p><p>&ldquo;I asked you to go with me yesterday because you are all I have left.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
