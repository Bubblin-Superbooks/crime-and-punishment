<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It all might be said, but there is something. Why did he say bluntly, &lsquo;With her&rsquo;? Why did Zametov add that I spoke artfully? Why do they speak in that tone? Yes, the tone.... Razumihin is sitting here, why does he see nothing? That innocent blockhead never does see anything! Feverish again! Did Porfiry wink at me just now? Of course it&rsquo;s nonsense! What could he wink for? Are they trying to upset my nerves or are they teasing me? Either it&rsquo;s ill fancy or they know! Even Zametov is rude.... Is Zametov rude? Zametov has changed his mind. I foresaw he would change his mind! He is at home here, while it&rsquo;s my first visit. Porfiry does not consider him a visitor; sits with his back to him. They&rsquo;re as thick as thieves, no doubt, over me! Not a doubt they were talking about me before we came.</p></div> </div>
