It&rsquo;s capital soup, yesterday&rsquo;s. I saved it for you yesterday, but you came in late. It&rsquo;s fine soup.&rdquo;</p><p>When the soup had been brought, and he had begun upon it, Nastasya sat down beside him on the sofa and began chatting.

What does she want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t pay her money and you won&rsquo;t turn out of the room. That&rsquo;s what she wants, to be sure.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;The devil, that&rsquo;s the last straw,&rdquo; he muttered, grinding his teeth, &ldquo;no, that would not suit me... just now. She is a fool,&rdquo; he added aloud. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and talk to her to-day.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
