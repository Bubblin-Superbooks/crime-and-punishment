<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Though he does take bribes.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, he does! and what of it? I don&rsquo;t care if he does take bribes,&rdquo; Razumihin cried with unnatural irritability. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t praise him for taking bribes. I only say he is a nice man in his own way! But if one looks at men in all ways&mdash;are there many good ones left? Why, I am sure I shouldn&rsquo;t be worth a baked onion myself... perhaps with you thrown in.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too little; I&rsquo;d give two for you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And I wouldn&rsquo;t give more than one for you. No more of your jokes! Zametov is no more than a boy. I can pull his hair and one must draw him not repel him. You&rsquo;ll never improve a man by repelling him, especially a boy. One has to be twice as careful with a boy.</p></div> </div>
