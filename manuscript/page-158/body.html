She&rsquo;s just eating her head off. Get in, I tell you! I&rsquo;ll make her gallop! She&rsquo;ll gallop!&rdquo; and he picked up the whip, preparing himself with relish to flog the little mare.</p><p>&ldquo;Get in! Come along!&rdquo; The crowd laughed. &ldquo;D&rsquo;you hear, she&rsquo;ll gallop!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Gallop indeed! She has not had a gallop in her for the last ten years!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll jog along!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you mind her, mates, bring a whip each of you, get ready!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
