<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>from the doctor, you understand, from the doctor himself, that&rsquo;s a very different thing from my account of him! If there&rsquo;s anything wrong, I swear I&rsquo;ll bring you here myself, but, if it&rsquo;s all right, you go to bed. And I&rsquo;ll spend the night here, in the passage, he won&rsquo;t hear me, and I&rsquo;ll tell Zossimov to sleep at the landlady&rsquo;s, to be at hand. Which is better for him: you or the doctor? So come home then! But the landlady is out of the question; it&rsquo;s all right for me, but it&rsquo;s out of the question for you: she wouldn&rsquo;t take you, for she&rsquo;s... for she&rsquo;s a fool... She&rsquo;d be jealous on my account of Avdotya Romanovna and of you, too, if you want to know... of Avdotya Romanovna certainly. She is an absolutely, absolutely unaccountable character! But I am a fool, too!... No matter! Come along! Do you trust me? Come, do you trust me or not?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
