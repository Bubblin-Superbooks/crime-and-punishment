Razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course, I am an ass,&rdquo; he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, &ldquo;but still... you are another.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, brother, not at all such another. I am not dreaming of any folly.&rdquo;</p><p>They walked along in silence and only when they were close to Raskolnikov&rsquo;s lodgings, Razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety.</p><p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a first-rate fellow, but among your other failings, you&rsquo;re a loose fish, that I know, and a dirty one, too. You are a feeble, nervous wretch, and a mass of whims, you&rsquo;re getting fat and lazy and can&rsquo;t deny yourself anything&mdash;</p></div> </div>
