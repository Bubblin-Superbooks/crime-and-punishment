<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Zametov told you all about it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, and he did well. Now I understand what it all means and so does Zametov.... Well, the fact is, Rodya... the point is... I am a little drunk now.... But that&rsquo;s... no matter... the point is that this idea... you understand? was just being hatched in their brains... you understand? That is, no one ventured to say it aloud, because the idea is too absurd and especially since the arrest of that painter, that bubble&rsquo;s burst and gone for ever. But why are they such fools? I gave Zametov a bit of a thrashing at the time&mdash;that&rsquo;s between ourselves, brother; please don&rsquo;t let out a hint that you know of it; I&rsquo;ve noticed he is a ticklish subject; it was at Luise Ivanovna&rsquo;s. But to-day, to-day it&rsquo;s all cleared up.</p></div> </div>
