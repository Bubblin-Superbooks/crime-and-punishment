But, dear me, what a cupboard he lives in! I wonder whether he is awake? Does this woman, his landlady, consider it a room? Listen, you say he does not like to show his feelings, so perhaps I shall annoy him with my... weaknesses? Do advise me, Dmitri Prokofitch, how am I to treat him? I feel quite distracted, you know.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t question him too much about anything if you see him frown; don&rsquo;t ask him too much about his health; he doesn&rsquo;t like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, Dmitri Prokofitch, how hard it is to be a mother! But here are the stairs.... What an awful staircase!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
