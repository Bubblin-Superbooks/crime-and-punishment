Have you told her?&rdquo; cried Dounia, horror-stricken. &ldquo;Surely you haven&rsquo;t done that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t tell her... in words; but she understood a great deal. She heard you talking in your sleep. I am sure she half understands it already. Perhaps I did wrong in going to see her. I don&rsquo;t know why I did go. I am a contemptible person, Dounia.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
