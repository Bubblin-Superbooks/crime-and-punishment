<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">tell you, for it&rsquo;s an interesting story, my marriage, in its own way. Where are you off to? Going again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not going away now.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;Not at all? We shall see. I&rsquo;ll take you there, I&rsquo;ll show you my betrothed, only not now. For you&rsquo;ll soon have to be off. You have to go to the right and I to the left. Do you know that Madame Resslich, the woman I am lodging with now, eh? I know what you&rsquo;re thinking, that she&rsquo;s the woman whose girl they say drowned herself in the winter. Come, are you listening? She arranged it all for me. You&rsquo;re bored, she said, you want something to fill up your time. For, you know, I am a gloomy, depressed person. Do you think I&rsquo;m light-hearted? No, I&rsquo;m gloomy. I do no harm, but sit in a corner without speaking a word for three days at a time. And that Resslich is a sly hussy, I tell you. I know what she has got in her mind; she thinks I shall get sick of it, abandon my wife and depart, and she&rsquo;ll get hold of her</p></div> </div>
