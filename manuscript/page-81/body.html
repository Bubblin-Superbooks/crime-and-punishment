And He will say unto us, &lsquo;Ye are swine, made in the Image of the Beast and with his mark; but come ye also!&rsquo; And the wise ones and those of understanding will say, &lsquo;Oh Lord, why dost Thou receive these men?&rsquo; And He will say, &lsquo;This is why I receive them, oh ye wise, this is why I receive them, oh ye of understanding, that not one of them believed himself to be worthy of this.&rsquo; And He will hold out His hands to us and we shall fall down before him... and we shall weep... and we shall understand all things! Then we shall understand all!... and all will understand, Katerina Ivanovna even... she will understand....</p></div> </div>
