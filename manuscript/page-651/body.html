<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">shall take you in, too. Ha-ha-ha! No, I&rsquo;ll tell you the truth. All these questions about crime, environment, children, recall to my mind an article of yours which interested me at the time. &lsquo;On Crime&rsquo;... or something of the sort, I forget the title, I read it with pleasure two months ago in the <em>Periodical Review</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;My article? In the <em>Periodical Review</em>?&rdquo; Raskolnikov asked in astonishment. &ldquo;I certainly did write an article upon a book six months ago when I left the university, but I sent it to the <em>Weekly Review</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But it came out in the <em>Periodical</em>.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the <em>Weekly Review</em> ceased to exist, so that&rsquo;s why it wasn&rsquo;t printed at the time.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; but when it ceased to exist, the <em>Weekly Review</em> was amalgamated with the <em>Periodical</em>, and so your article appeared two months ago in the latter. Didn&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov had not known.</p></div> </div>
