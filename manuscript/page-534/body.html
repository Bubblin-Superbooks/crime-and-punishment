<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mercy on it! it&rsquo;s our Afrosinya!&rdquo; a woman cried tearfully close by. &ldquo;Mercy! save her! kind people, pull her out!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A boat, a boat&rdquo; was shouted in the crowd. But there was no need of a boat; a policeman ran down the steps to the canal, threw off his great coat and his boots and rushed into the water. It was easy to reach her: she floated within a couple of yards from the steps, he caught hold of her clothes with his right hand and with his left seized a pole which a comrade held out to him; the drowning woman was pulled out at once. They laid her on the granite pavement of the embankment. She soon recovered consciousness, raised her head, sat up and began sneezing and coughing, stupidly wiping her wet dress with her hands. She said nothing.</p></div> </div>
