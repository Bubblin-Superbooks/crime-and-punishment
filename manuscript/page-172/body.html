They will be here too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo; said Lizaveta slowly and thoughtfully, as though unable to make up her mind.</p><p>&ldquo;Upon my word, what a fright you are in of Alyona Ivanovna,&rdquo; gabbled the huckster&rsquo;s wife, a lively little woman. &ldquo;I look at you, you are like some little babe. And she is not your own sister either&mdash;nothing but a step-sister and what a hand she keeps over you!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But this time don&rsquo;t say a word to Alyona Ivanovna,&rdquo; her husband interrupted; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my advice, but come round to us without asking. It will be worth your while. Later on your sister herself may have a notion.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
