<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained two ways, that&rsquo;s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do you understand? And I shall, for I&rsquo;ve learnt my lesson. But they will certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened, they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-day.... But that&rsquo;s no matter, Sonia; they&rsquo;ll let me out again... for there isn&rsquo;t any real proof against me, and there won&rsquo;t be, I give you my word for it. And they can&rsquo;t convict a man on what they have against me. Enough.... I only tell you that you may know.... I will try to manage somehow to put it to my mother and sister so that they won&rsquo;t be frightened.... My sister&rsquo;s future is secure, however, now, I believe... and my mother&rsquo;s must be too.... Well, that&rsquo;s all. Be careful, though. Will you come and see me in prison when I am there?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
