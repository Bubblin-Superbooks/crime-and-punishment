I, so to speak, give them into your keeping, Razumihin. I say this because I know quite well how you love her, and am convinced of the purity of your heart. I know that she too may love you and perhaps does love you already. Now decide for yourself, as you know best, whether you need go in for a drinking bout or not.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rodya! You see... well.... Ach, damn it! But where do you mean to go? Of course, if it&rsquo;s all a secret, never mind.... But I... I shall find out the secret... and I am sure that it must be some ridiculous nonsense and that you&rsquo;ve made it all up. Anyway you are a capital fellow, a capital fellow!...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
