<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You seem trying to enrage me, to make me leave you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a queer fellow! But here we are. Welcome to the staircase. You see, that&rsquo;s the way to Sofya Semyonovna. Look, there is no one at home. Don&rsquo;t you believe me? Ask Kapernaumov. She leaves the key with him. Here is Madame de Kapernaumov herself. Hey, what? She is rather deaf. Has she gone out? Where? Did you hear? She is not in and won&rsquo;t be till late in the evening probably. Well, come to my room; you wanted to come and see me, didn&rsquo;t you? Here we are. Madame Resslich&rsquo;s not at home. She is a woman who is always busy, an excellent woman I assure you.... She might have been of use to you if you had been a little more sensible. Now, see! I take this five-per-cent bond out of the bureau&mdash;see what a lot I&rsquo;ve got of them still&mdash;this one will be turned into cash to-day.</p></div> </div>
