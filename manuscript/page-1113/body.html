<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">you how the whole business, the whole misunderstanding arose. I&rsquo;ve caused you a great deal of suffering, Rodion Romanovitch. I am not a monster. I understand what it must mean for a man who has been unfortunate, but who is proud, imperious and above all, impatient, to have to bear such treatment! I regard you in any case as a man of noble character and not without elements of magnanimity, though I don&rsquo;t agree with all your convictions. I wanted to tell you this first, frankly and quite sincerely, for above all I don&rsquo;t want to deceive you. When I made your acquaintance, I felt attracted by you. Perhaps you will laugh at my saying so. You have a right to. I know you disliked me from the first and indeed you&rsquo;ve no reason to like me. You may think what you like, but I desire now to do all I can to efface that impression and to show that I am a man of heart and conscience. I speak sincerely.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">Porfiry Petrovitch made a dignified pause.</p></div> </div>
