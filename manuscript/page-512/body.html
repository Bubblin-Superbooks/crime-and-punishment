Oh, yes....&rdquo; Raskolnikov sipped the glass, put a morsel of bread in his mouth and, suddenly looking at Zametov, seemed to remember everything and pulled himself together. At the same moment his face resumed its original mocking expression. He went on drinking tea.</p><p>&ldquo;There have been a great many of these crimes lately,&rdquo; said Zametov. &ldquo;Only the other day I read in the Moscow News that a whole gang of false coiners had been caught in Moscow.
