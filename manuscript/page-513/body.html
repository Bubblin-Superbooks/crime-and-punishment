I read about it a month ago,&rdquo; Raskolnikov answered calmly. &ldquo;So you consider them criminals?&rdquo; he added, smiling.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course they are criminals.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They? They are children, simpletons, not criminals! Why, half a hundred people meeting for such an object&mdash;what an idea! Three would be too many, and then they want to have more faith in one another than in themselves! One has only to blab in his cups and it all collapses. Simpletons! They engaged untrustworthy people to change the notes&mdash;what a thing to trust to a casual stranger! Well, let us suppose that these simpletons succeed and each makes a million, and what follows for the rest of their lives? Each is dependent on the others for the rest of his life! Better hang oneself at once! And they did not know how to change the notes either;</p></div> </div>
