<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s all Rodya, precious Rodya, her first born! For such a son who would not sacrifice such a daughter! Oh, loving, over-partial hearts! Why, for his sake we would not shrink even from Sonia&rsquo;s fate. Sonia, Sonia Marmeladov, the eternal victim so long as the world lasts. Have you taken the measure of your sacrifice, both of you? Is it right? Can you bear it? Is it any use? Is there sense in it? And let me tell you, Dounia, Sonia&rsquo;s life is no worse than life with Mr. Luzhin. &lsquo;There can be no question of love,&rsquo; mother writes. And what if there can be no respect either, if on the contrary there is aversion, contempt, repulsion, what then? So you will have to &lsquo;keep up your appearance,&rsquo; too.</p></div> </div>
