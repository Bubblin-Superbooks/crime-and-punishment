<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But it&rsquo;s no use going over that! Sonia, as you may well fancy, has had no education. I did make an effort four years ago to give her a course of geography and universal history, but as I was not very well up in those subjects myself and we had no suitable books, and what books we had... hm, anyway we have not even those now, so all our instruction came to an end. We stopped at Cyrus of Persia. Since she has attained years of maturity, she has read other books of romantic tendency and of late she had read with great interest a book she got through Mr. Lebeziatnikov, Lewes&rsquo; Physiology&mdash;do you know it?&mdash;and even recounted extracts from it to us: and that&rsquo;s the whole of her education. And now may I venture to address you, honoured sir, on my own account with a private question.</p></div> </div>
