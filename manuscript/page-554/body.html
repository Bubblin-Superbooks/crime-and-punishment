<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Blood was flowing from his head and face; his face was crushed, mutilated and disfigured. He was evidently badly injured.</p><p>&ldquo;Merciful heaven!&rdquo; wailed the coachman, &ldquo;what more could I do? If I&rsquo;d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can&rsquo;t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling. I shouted again and a second and a third time, then I held the horses in, but he fell straight under their feet! Either he did it on purpose or he was very tipsy.... The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That&rsquo;s how it happened!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
