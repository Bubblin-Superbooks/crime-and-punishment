I have another, a copper one that belonged to Lizaveta. I changed with Lizaveta: she gave me her cross and I gave her my little ikon. I will wear Lizaveta&rsquo;s now and give you this. Take it... it&rsquo;s mine! It&rsquo;s mine, you know,&rdquo; she begged him. &ldquo;We will go to suffer together, and together we will bear our cross!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give it me,&rdquo; said Raskolnikov.</p><p>He did not want to hurt her feelings. But immediately he drew back the hand he held out for the cross.</p><p>&ldquo;Not now, Sonia. Better later,&rdquo; he added to comfort her.</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, better,&rdquo; she repeated with conviction, &ldquo;when you go to meet your suffering, then put it on. You will come to me, I&rsquo;ll put it on you, we will pray and go together.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
