<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>he, the drunken noisy braggart of last night? Was it possible to imagine so absurd and cynical a juxtaposition? Razumihin blushed desperately at the very idea and suddenly the recollection forced itself vividly upon him of how he had said last night on the stairs that the landlady would be jealous of Avdotya Romanovna... that was simply intolerable. He brought his fist down heavily on the kitchen stove, hurt his hand and sent one of the bricks flying.</p><p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he muttered to himself a minute later with a feeling of self-abasement, &ldquo;of course, all these infamies can never be wiped out or smoothed over... and so it&rsquo;s useless even to think of it, and I must go to them in silence and do my duty... in silence, too... and not ask forgiveness, and say nothing... for all is lost now!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
