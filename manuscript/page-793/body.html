<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>s why they instinctively dislike history, &lsquo;nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it,&rsquo; and they explain it all as stupidity! That&rsquo;s why they so dislike the living process of life; they don&rsquo;t want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul won&rsquo;t obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of India-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and won&rsquo;t revolt! And it comes in the end to their reducing everything to the building of walls and the planning of rooms and passages in a phalanstery! The phalanstery is ready, indeed, but your human nature is not ready for the phalanstery&mdash;it wants life, it hasn&rsquo;t completed its vital process, it&rsquo;s too soon for the graveyard! You can&rsquo;t skip over nature by logic.</p></div> </div>
