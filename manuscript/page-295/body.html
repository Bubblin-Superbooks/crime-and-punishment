Raskolnikov pulled away his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have come for this: I have no lessons.... I wanted,... but I don&rsquo;t really want lessons....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But I say! You are delirious, you know!&rdquo; Razumihin observed, watching him carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to Razumihin&rsquo;s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face. Now, in a flash, he knew, that what he was least of all disposed for at that moment was to be face to face with anyone in the wide world. His spleen rose within him. He almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin&rsquo;s threshold.</p></div> </div>
