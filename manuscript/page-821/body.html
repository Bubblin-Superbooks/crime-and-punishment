Razumihin was scowling gloomily. He seemed before this to be noticing something. He looked angrily around. There was a minute of gloomy silence. Raskolnikov turned to go.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you going already?&rdquo; Porfiry said amiably, holding out his hand with excessive politeness. &ldquo;Very, very glad of your acquaintance. As for your request, have no uneasiness, write just as I told you, or, better still, come to me there yourself in a day or two... to-morrow, indeed. I shall be there at eleven o&rsquo;clock for certain.</p></div> </div>
