<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Then came interviews, mysterious conversations, exhortations, entreaties, supplications, even tears&mdash;would you believe it, even tears? Think what the passion for propaganda will bring some girls to! I, of course, threw it all on my destiny, posed as hungering and thirsting for light, and finally resorted to the most powerful weapon in the subjection of the female heart, a weapon which never fails one. It&rsquo;s the well-known resource&mdash;flattery. Nothing in the world is harder than speaking the truth and nothing easier than flattery. If there&rsquo;s the hundredth part of a false note in speaking the truth, it leads to a discord, and that leads to trouble. But if all, to the last note, is false in flattery, it is just as agreeable, and is heard not without satisfaction. It may be a coarse satisfaction, but still a satisfaction. And however coarse the flattery, at least half will be sure to seem true.</p></div> </div>
