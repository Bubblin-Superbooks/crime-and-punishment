So they asked him this and that, how old he is, &lsquo;twenty-two,&rsquo; and so on. At the question, &lsquo;When you were working with Dmitri, didn&rsquo;t you see anyone on the staircase at such-and-such a time?&rsquo;&mdash;answer: &lsquo;To be sure folks may have gone up and down, but I did not notice them.&rsquo; &lsquo;And didn&rsquo;t you hear anything, any noise, and so on?&rsquo; &lsquo;We heard nothing special.&rsquo; &lsquo;And did you hear, Nikolay, that on the same day Widow So-and-so and her sister were murdered and robbed?&rsquo; &lsquo;I never knew a thing about it. The first I heard of it was from Afanasy Pavlovitch the day before yesterday.&rsquo; &lsquo;And where did you find the ear-rings?&rsquo; &lsquo;I found them on the pavement.</p></div> </div>
