One ran each side.</p><p>&ldquo;Hit her in the face, in the eyes, in the eyes,&rdquo; cried Mikolka.</p><p>&ldquo;Give us a song, mates,&rdquo; shouted someone in the cart and everyone in the cart joined in a riotous song, jingling a tambourine and whistling. The woman went on cracking nuts and laughing.</p><p>... He ran beside the mare, ran in front of her, saw her being whipped across the eyes, right in the eyes! He was crying, he felt choking, his tears were streaming. One of the men gave him a cut with the whip across the face, he did not feel it. Wringing his hands and screaming, he rushed up to the grey-headed old man with the grey beard, who was shaking his head in disapproval.</p></div> </div>
