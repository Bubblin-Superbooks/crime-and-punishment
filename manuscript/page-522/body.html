What were you talking about behind my back when I went out of the police-office? And why did the explosive lieutenant question me after I fainted? Hey, there,&rdquo; he shouted to the waiter, getting up and taking his cap, &ldquo;how much?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Thirty copecks,&rdquo; the latter replied, running up.</p><p>&ldquo;And there is twenty copecks for vodka. See what a lot of money!&rdquo; he held out his shaking hand to Zametov with notes in it. &ldquo;Red notes and blue, twenty-five roubles. Where did I get them? And where did my new clothes come from? You know I had not a copeck. You&rsquo;ve cross-examined my landlady, I&rsquo;ll be bound.... Well, that&rsquo;s enough! Assez caus√©! Till we meet again!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
