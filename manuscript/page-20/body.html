It would be interesting to know what it is men are most afraid of. Taking a new step, uttering a new word is what they fear most.... But I am talking too much. It&rsquo;s because I chatter that I do nothing. Or perhaps it is that I chatter because I do nothing. I&rsquo;ve learned to chatter this last month, lying for days together in my den thinking... of Jack the Giant-killer. Why am I going there now? Am I capable of that? Is that serious? It is not serious at all. It&rsquo;s simply a fantasy to amuse myself; a plaything! Yes, maybe it is a plaything.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
