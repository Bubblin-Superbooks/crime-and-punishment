<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Svidriga誰lov occupied two fairly large furnished rooms. Dounia was looking about her mistrustfully, but saw nothing special in the furniture or position of the rooms. Yet there was something to observe, for instance, that Svidriga誰lov&rsquo;s flat was exactly between two sets of almost uninhabited apartments. His rooms were not entered directly from the passage, but through the landlady&rsquo;s two almost empty rooms. Unlocking a door leading out of his bedroom, Svidriga誰lov showed Dounia the two empty rooms that were to let. Dounia stopped in the doorway, not knowing what she was called to look upon, but Svidriga誰lov hastened to explain.</p><p>&ldquo;Look here, at this second large room. Notice that door, it&rsquo;s locked. By the door stands a chair, the only one in the two rooms. I brought it from my rooms so as to listen more conveniently.</p></div> </div>
