<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Stop, stop! You queer fish.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to,&rdquo; said the other, again pulling away his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;Then why the devil have you come? Are you mad, or what? Why, this is... almost insulting! I won&rsquo;t let you go like that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then, I came to you because I know no one but you who could help... to begin... because you are kinder than anyone&mdash;cleverer, I mean, and can judge... and now I see that I want nothing. Do you hear? Nothing at all... no one&rsquo;s services... no one&rsquo;s sympathy. I am by myself... alone. Come, that&rsquo;s enough. Leave me alone.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
