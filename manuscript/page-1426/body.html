I spent seven years in the country with Marfa Petrovna, so now when I come across an intelligent person like you&mdash;intelligent and highly interesting&mdash;I am simply glad to talk and, besides, I&rsquo;ve drunk that half-glass of champagne and it&rsquo;s gone to my head a little. And besides, there&rsquo;s a certain fact that has wound me up tremendously, but about that I... will keep quiet. Where are you off to?&rdquo; he asked in alarm.</p></div> </div>
