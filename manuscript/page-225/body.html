The unknown rang again, waited and suddenly tugged violently and impatiently at the handle of the door. Raskolnikov gazed in horror at the hook shaking in its fastening, and in blank terror expected every minute that the fastening would be pulled out. It certainly did seem possible, so violently was he shaking it. He was tempted to hold the fastening, but <em>he</em> might be aware of it. A giddiness came over him again. &ldquo;I shall fall down!&rdquo; flashed through his mind, but the unknown began to speak and he recovered himself at once.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up? Are they asleep or murdered? D-damn them!&rdquo; he bawled in a thick voice, &ldquo;Hey, Alyona Ivanovna, old witch! Lizaveta Ivanovna, hey, my beauty! open the door! Oh, damn them! Are they asleep or what?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
