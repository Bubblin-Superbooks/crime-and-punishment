You are delirious, you know!&rdquo; Razumihin observed, watching him carefully.</p><p>&ldquo;No, I am not.&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov got up from the sofa. As he had mounted the stairs to Razumihin&rsquo;s, he had not realised that he would be meeting his friend face to face.

He almost choked with rage at himself as soon as he crossed Razumihin&rsquo;s threshold.</p><p>&ldquo;Good-bye,&rdquo; he said abruptly, and walked to the door.</p></div> </div>
