You are an ironical person! Come, till we meet!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I believe we can say <em>good-bye</em>!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s hands,&rdquo; muttered Porfiry, with an unnatural smile.</p><p>As he walked through the office, Raskolnikov noticed that many people were looking at him. Among them he saw the two porters from <em>the</em> house, whom he had invited that night to the police station. They stood there waiting. But he was no sooner on the stairs than he heard the voice of Porfiry Petrovitch behind him. Turning round, he saw the latter running after him, out of breath.</p><p>&ldquo;One word, Rodion Romanovitch; as to all the rest, it&rsquo;s in God&rsquo;s hands, but as a matter of form there are some questions I shall have to ask you... so we shall meet again, shan&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
