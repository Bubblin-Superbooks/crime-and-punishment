We meet once in five years.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is he?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been stagnating all his life as a district postmaster; gets a little pension. He is sixty-five&mdash;not worth talking about.... But I am fond of him. Porfiry Petrovitch, the head of the Investigation Department here... But you know him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Is he a relation of yours, too?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A very distant one. But why are you scowling? Because you quarrelled once, won&rsquo;t you come then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care a damn for him.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So much the better. Well, there will be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and Zametov.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Do tell me, please, what you or he&rdquo;&mdash;Zossimov nodded at Raskolnikov&mdash;&ldquo;can have in common with this Zametov?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
