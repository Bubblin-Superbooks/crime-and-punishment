Good-bye, till we meet then&mdash;I embrace you warmly, warmly, with many kisses.</p><p>&ldquo;Yours till death,</p><p>&ldquo;PULCHERIA RASKOLNIKOV.&rdquo;</p><p>Almost from the first, while he read the letter, Raskolnikov&rsquo;s face was wet with tears; but when he finished it, his face was pale and distorted and a bitter, wrathful and malignant smile was on his lips.
