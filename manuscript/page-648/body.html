<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all about it! There&rsquo;s an element of attraction here, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Then why have you fascinated her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t fascinated her; perhaps I was fascinated myself in my folly. But she won&rsquo;t care a straw whether it&rsquo;s you or I, so long as somebody sits beside her, sighing.... I can&rsquo;t explain the position, brother... look here, you are good at mathematics, and working at it now... begin teaching her the integral calculus; upon my soul, I&rsquo;m not joking, I&rsquo;m in earnest, it&rsquo;ll be just the same to her. She will gaze at you and sigh for a whole year together. I talked to her once for two days at a time about the Prussian House of Lords (for one must talk of something)&mdash;she just sighed and perspired! And you mustn&rsquo;t talk of love&mdash;she&rsquo;s bashful to hysterics&mdash;</p></div> </div>
