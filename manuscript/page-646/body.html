But what am I to do with her?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much trouble, I assure you. Talk any rot you like to her, as long as you sit by her and talk. You&rsquo;re a doctor, too; try curing her of something. I swear you won&rsquo;t regret it. She has a piano, and you know, I strum a little. I have a song there, a genuine Russian one: &lsquo;I shed hot tears.</p></div> </div>
