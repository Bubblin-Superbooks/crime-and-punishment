<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>t! I was breaking my heart, Rodya, six or seven days ago over your food and your clothes and the way you are living. But now I see again how foolish I was, for you can attain any position you like by your intellect and talent. No doubt you don&rsquo;t care about that for the present and you are occupied with much more important matters....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Dounia&rsquo;s not at home, mother?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, Rodya. I often don&rsquo;t see her; she leaves me alone. Dmitri Prokofitch comes to see me, it&rsquo;s so good of him, and he always talks about you. He loves you and respects you, my dear. I don&rsquo;t say that Dounia is very wanting in consideration. I am not complaining. She has her ways and I have mine; she seems to have got some secrets of late and I never have any secrets from you two.</p></div> </div>
