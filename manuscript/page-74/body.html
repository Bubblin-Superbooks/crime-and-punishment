What does my hair matter! Bother my hair! That&rsquo;s what I say! Indeed it will be better if she does begin pulling it, that&rsquo;s not what I am afraid of... it&rsquo;s her eyes I am afraid of... yes, her eyes... the red on her cheeks, too, frightens me... and her breathing too.... Have you noticed how people in that disease breathe... when they are excited? I am frightened of the children&rsquo;s crying, too.... For if Sonia has not taken them food... I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s happened! I don&rsquo;t know! But blows I am not afraid of.... Know, sir, that such blows are not a pain to me, but even an enjoyment. In fact I can&rsquo;t get on without it.... It&rsquo;s better so. Let her strike me, it relieves her heart... it&rsquo;s better so... There is the house. The house of Kozel, the cabinet-maker... a German, well-to-do. Lead the way!&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">They went in from the yard and up to the fourth</p></div> </div>
