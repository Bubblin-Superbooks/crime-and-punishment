She said nothing, she only looked at me without a word.... Not on earth, but up yonder... they grieve over men, they weep, but they don&rsquo;t blame them, they don&rsquo;t blame them! But it hurts more, it hurts more when they don&rsquo;t blame! Thirty copecks yes! And maybe she needs them now, eh? What do you think, my dear sir? For now she&rsquo;s got to keep up her appearance. It costs money, that smartness, that special smartness, you know? Do you understand? And there&rsquo;s pomatum, too, you see, she must have things; petticoats, starched ones, shoes, too, real jaunty ones to show off her foot when she has to step over a puddle.</p></div> </div>
