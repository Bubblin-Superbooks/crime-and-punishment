<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I have noticed more than once in my life that husbands don&rsquo;t quite get on with their mothers-in-law, and I don&rsquo;t want to be the least bit in anyone&rsquo;s way, and for my own sake, too, would rather be quite independent, so long as I have a crust of bread of my own, and such children as you and Dounia. If possible, I would settle somewhere near you, for the most joyful piece of news, dear Rodya, I have kept for the end of my letter: know then, my dear boy, that we may, perhaps, be all together in a very short time and may embrace one another again after a separation of almost three years! It is settled for certain that Dounia and I are to set off for Petersburg, exactly when I don&rsquo;t know, but very, very soon, possibly in a week. It all depends on Pyotr Petrovitch who will let us know when he has had time to look round him in Petersburg.</p></div> </div>
