<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> presented by Tchebarov, the new paint, thirty degrees Reaumur and a stifling atmosphere, a crowd of people, the talk about the murder of a person where he had been just before, and all that on an empty stomach&mdash;he might well have a fainting fit! And that, that is what they found it all on! Damn them! I understand how annoying it is, but in your place, Rodya, I would laugh at them, or better still, spit in their ugly faces, and spit a dozen times in all directions. I&rsquo;d hit out in all directions, neatly too, and so I&rsquo;d put an end to it. Damn them! Don&rsquo;t be downhearted. It&rsquo;s a shame!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He really has put it well, though,&rdquo; Raskolnikov thought.</p></div> </div>
