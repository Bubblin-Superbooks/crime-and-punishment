<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>when they overstep all obstacles,&rsquo; as you wittily and cleverly expressed it yesterday. He will lie&mdash;that is, the man who is a special case, the incognito, and he will lie well, in the cleverest fashion; you might think he would triumph and enjoy the fruits of his wit, but at the most interesting, the most flagrant moment he will faint.
