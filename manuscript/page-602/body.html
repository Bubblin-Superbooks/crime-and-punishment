He, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence. &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;I want to talk to you. You are perhaps in a hurry, but please, be so kind, spare me two minutes,&rdquo; and he drew up a chair for her.</p><p>Sonia sat down again, and again timidly she took a hurried, frightened look at the two ladies, and dropped her eyes. Raskolnikov&rsquo;s pale face flushed, a shudder passed over him, his eyes glowed.</p><p>&ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, firmly and insistently, &ldquo;this is Sofya Semyonovna Marmeladov, the daughter of that unfortunate Mr. Marmeladov, who was run over yesterday before my eyes, and of whom I was just telling you.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
