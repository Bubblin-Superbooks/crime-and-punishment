<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For our landlady, Amalia Fyodorovna would not hear of it (though she had backed up Darya Frantsovna before) and Mr. Lebeziatnikov too... hm.... All the trouble between him and Katerina Ivanovna was on Sonia&rsquo;s account. At first he was for making up to Sonia himself and then all of a sudden he stood on his dignity: &lsquo;how,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;can a highly educated man like me live in the same rooms with a girl like that?&rsquo; And Katerina Ivanovna would not let it pass, she stood up for her... and so that&rsquo;s how it happened. And Sonia comes to us now, mostly after dark; she comforts Katerina Ivanovna and gives her all she can.... She has a room at the Kapernaumovs&rsquo; the tailors, she lodges with them; Kapernaumov is a lame man with a cleft palate and all of his numerous family have cleft palates too. And his wife, too, has a cleft palate.</p></div> </div>
