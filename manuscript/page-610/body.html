What if Pyotr Petrovitch breaks it off?&rdquo; poor Pulcheria Alexandrovna blurted out, incautiously.</p><p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t be worth much if he does,&rdquo; answered Dounia, sharply and contemptuously.</p><p>&ldquo;We did well to come away,&rdquo; Pulcheria Alexandrovna hurriedly broke in. &ldquo;He was in a hurry about some business or other. If he gets out and has a breath of air... it is fearfully close in his room.... But where is one to get a breath of air here? The very streets here feel like shut-up rooms. Good heavens! what a town!... stay... this side... they will crush you&mdash;carrying something. Why, it is a piano they have got, I declare... how they push!... I am very much afraid of that young woman, too.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What young woman, mother?</p><p>&ldquo;Why, that Sofya Semyonovna, who was there just now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
