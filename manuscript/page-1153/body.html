There are few places where there are so many gloomy, strong and queer influences on the soul of man as in Petersburg. The mere influences of climate mean so much. And it&rsquo;s the administrative centre of all Russia and its character must be reflected on the whole country. But that is neither here nor there now. The point is that I have several times watched you. You walk out of your house&mdash;holding your head high&mdash;twenty paces from home you let it sink, and fold your hands behind your back. You look and evidently see nothing before nor beside you. At last you begin moving your lips and talking to yourself, and sometimes you wave one hand and declaim, and at last stand still in the middle of the road. That&rsquo;s not at all the thing. Someone may be watching you besides me, and it won&rsquo;t do you any good. It&rsquo;s nothing really to do with me and I can&rsquo;t cure you, but, of course, you understand me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
