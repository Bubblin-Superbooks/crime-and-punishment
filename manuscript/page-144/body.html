<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Well,... mother I don&rsquo;t wonder at, it&rsquo;s like her, God bless her, but how could Dounia? Dounia darling, as though I did not know you! You were nearly twenty when I saw you last: I understood you then. Mother writes that &lsquo;Dounia can put up with a great deal.&rsquo; I know that very well. I knew that two years and a half ago, and for the last two and a half years I have been thinking about it, thinking of just that, that &lsquo;Dounia can put up with a great deal.&rsquo; If she could put up with Mr. Svidriga√Ølov and all the rest of it, she certainly can put up with a great deal. And now mother and she have taken it into their heads that she can put up with Mr. Luzhin, who propounds the theory of the superiority of wives raised from destitution and owing everything to their husband&rsquo;s bounty&mdash;who propounds it, too, almost at the first interview.</p></div> </div>
