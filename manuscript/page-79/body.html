Why am I to be pitied?&rdquo; Marmeladov suddenly declaimed, standing up with his arm outstretched, as though he had been only waiting for that question.</p><p>&ldquo;Why am I to be pitied, you say? Yes! there&rsquo;s nothing to pity me for! I ought to be crucified, crucified on a cross, not pitied! Crucify me, oh judge, crucify me but pity me! And then I will go of myself to be crucified, for it&rsquo;s not merry-making I seek but tears and tribulation!... Do you suppose, you that sell, that this pint of yours has been sweet to me? It was tribulation I sought at the bottom of it, tears and tribulation, and have found it, and I have tasted it; but He will pity us Who has had pity on all men, Who has understood all men and all things, He is the One, He too is the judge.</p></div> </div>
