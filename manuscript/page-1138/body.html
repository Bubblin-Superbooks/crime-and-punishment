<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">ceased to believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you. And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If you ran away, you&rsquo;d come back to yourself. <em>You can&rsquo;t get on without us.</em> And if I put you in prison&mdash;say you&rsquo;ve been there a month, or two, or three&mdash;remember my word, you&rsquo;ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise. You won&rsquo;t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, &lsquo;to take your suffering.&rsquo; You don&rsquo;t believe my words now, but you&rsquo;ll come to it of yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don&rsquo;t laugh at it, there&rsquo;s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won&rsquo;t run away, Rodion Romanovitch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
