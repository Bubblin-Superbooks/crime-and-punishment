And perhaps, he was irritated at having no facts, and blurted it out in his vexation&mdash;or perhaps he has some plan... he seems an intelligent man. Perhaps he wanted to frighten me by pretending to know. They have a psychology of their own, brother. But it is loathsome explaining it all. Stop!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
