<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Oh, how sick he was of it all!</p><p>And yet he was hastening to Svidriga誰lov; could he be expecting something new from him, information, or means of escape? Men will catch at straws! Was it destiny or some instinct bringing them together? Perhaps it was only fatigue, despair; perhaps it was not Svidriga誰lov but some other whom he needed, and Svidriga誰lov had simply presented himself by chance. Sonia? But what should he go to Sonia for now? To beg her tears again? He was afraid of Sonia, too. Sonia stood before him as an irrevocable sentence. He must go his own way or hers. At that moment especially he did not feel equal to seeing her. No, would it not be better to try Svidriga誰lov? And he could not help inwardly owning that he had long felt that he must see him for some reason.</p></div> </div>
