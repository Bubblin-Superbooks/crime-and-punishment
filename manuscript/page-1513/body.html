Giving it to you is the same as my giving it to him. Besides, you promised Amalia Ivanovna to pay what&rsquo;s owing. I heard you. How can you undertake such obligations so heedlessly, Sofya Semyonovna? It was Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s debt and not yours, so you ought not to have taken any notice of the German woman. You can&rsquo;t get through the world like that. If you are ever questioned about me&mdash;to-morrow or the day after you will be asked&mdash;don&rsquo;t say anything about my coming to see you now and don&rsquo;t show the money to anyone or say a word about it. Well, now good-bye.&rdquo; (He got up.) &ldquo;My greetings to Rodion Romanovitch. By the way, you&rsquo;d better put the money for the present in Mr. Razumihin&rsquo;s keeping. You know Mr. Razumihin? Of course you do.</p></div> </div>
