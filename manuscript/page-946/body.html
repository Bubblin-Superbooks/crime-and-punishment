<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy&mdash;was without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna. Finally one person having no suit appeared in his dressing-gown, but this was too much, and the efforts of Amalia Ivanovna and the Pole succeeded in removing him. The Pole brought with him, however, two other Poles who did not live at Amalia Ivanovna&rsquo;s and whom no one had seen here before. All this irritated Katerina Ivanovna intensely. &ldquo;For whom had they made all these preparations then?&rdquo; To make room for the visitors the children had not even been laid for at the table; but the two little ones were sitting on a bench in the furthest corner with their dinner laid on a box, while Polenka as a big girl had to look after them, feed them, and keep their noses wiped like well-bred children&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
