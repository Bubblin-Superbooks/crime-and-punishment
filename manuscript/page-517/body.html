Though I&rsquo;ve been calling them all sorts of names just now, I do respect them all... though I don&rsquo;t respect Zametov, I like him, for he is a puppy, and that bullock Zossimov, because he is an honest man and knows his work. But enough, it&rsquo;s all said and forgiven. Is it forgiven? Well, then, let&rsquo;s go on. I know this corridor, I&rsquo;ve been here, there was a scandal here at Number 3.... Where are you here? Which number? eight? Well, lock yourselves in for the night, then. Don&rsquo;t let anybody in. In a quarter of an hour I&rsquo;ll come back with news, and half an hour later I&rsquo;ll bring Zossimov, you&rsquo;ll see! Good-bye, I&rsquo;ll run.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;Good heavens, Dounia, what is going to happen?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
