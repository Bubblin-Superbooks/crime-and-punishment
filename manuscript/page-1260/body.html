<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>and by that time my mother would be worn out with grief and anxiety and I could not succeed in keeping her in comfort while my sister... well, my sister might well have fared worse! And it&rsquo;s a hard thing to pass everything by all one&rsquo;s life, to turn one&rsquo;s back upon everything, to forget one&rsquo;s mother and decorously accept the insults inflicted on one&rsquo;s sister. Why should one? When one has buried them to burden oneself with others&mdash;wife and children&mdash;and to leave them again without a farthing? So I resolved to gain possession of the old woman&rsquo;s money and to use it for my first years without worrying my mother, to keep myself at the university and for a little while after leaving it&mdash;and to do this all on a broad, thorough scale, so as to build up a completely new career and enter upon a new life of independence.... Well... that&rsquo;s all.... Well, of course in killing the old woman I did wrong.... Well, that&rsquo;s enough.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
