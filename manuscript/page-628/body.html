<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Through error you come to the truth! I am a man because I err! You never reach any truth without making fourteen mistakes and very likely a hundred and fourteen. And a fine thing, too, in its way; but we can&rsquo;t even make mistakes on our own account! Talk nonsense, but talk your own nonsense, and I&rsquo;ll kiss you for it. To go wrong in one&rsquo;s own way is better than to go right in someone else&rsquo;s. In the first case you are a man, in the second you&rsquo;re no better than a bird. Truth won&rsquo;t escape you, but life can be cramped. There have been examples. And what are we doing now? In science, development, thought, invention, ideals, aims, liberalism, judgment, experience and everything, everything, everything, we are still in the preparatory class at school.</p></div> </div>
