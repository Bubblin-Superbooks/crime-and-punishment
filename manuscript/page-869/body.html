He-he-he!&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov looked haughtily and contemptuously at him.</p><p>&ldquo;Briefly,&rdquo; he said loudly and imperiously, rising to his feet and in so doing pushing Porfiry back a little, &ldquo;briefly, I want to know, do you acknowledge me perfectly free from suspicion or not? Tell me, Porfiry Petrovitch, tell me once for all and make haste!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What a business I&rsquo;m having with you!&rdquo; cried Porfiry with a perfectly good-humoured, sly and composed face. &ldquo;And why do you want to know, why do you want to know so much, since they haven&rsquo;t begun to worry you? Why, you are like a child asking for matches! And why are you so uneasy? Why do you force yourself upon us, eh? He-he-he!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I repeat,&rdquo; Raskolnikov cried furiously, &ldquo;that I can&rsquo;t put up with it!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
