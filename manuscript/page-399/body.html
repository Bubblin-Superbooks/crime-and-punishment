<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Zametov? The head clerk? What for?&rdquo; Raskolnikov turned round quickly and fixed his eyes on Razumihin.</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?... What are you upset about? He wanted to make your acquaintance because I talked to him a lot about you.... How could I have found out so much except from him? He is a capital fellow, brother, first-rate... in his own way, of course. Now we are friends&mdash;see each other almost every day. I have moved into this part, you know. I have only just moved. I&rsquo;ve been with him to Luise Ivanovna once or twice.... Do you remember Luise, Luise Ivanovna?</p></div> </div>
