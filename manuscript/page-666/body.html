What am I to tell you? I have known Rodion for a year and a half; he is morose, gloomy, proud and haughty, and of late&mdash;and perhaps for a long time before&mdash;he has been suspicious and fanciful. He has a noble nature and a kind heart. He does not like showing his feelings and would rather do a cruel thing than open his heart freely. Sometimes, though, he is not at all morbid, but simply cold and inhumanly callous; it&rsquo;s as though he were alternating between two characters.</p></div> </div>
