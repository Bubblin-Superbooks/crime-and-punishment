<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Mr. Razumihin!&rdquo; cried Porfiry Petrovitch, seeming glad of a question from Raskolnikov, who had till then been silent. &ldquo;He-he-he! But I had to put Mr. Razumihin off; two is company, three is none. Mr. Razumihin is not the right man, besides he is an outsider. He came running to me with a pale face.... But never mind him, why bring him in? To return to Nikolay, would you like to know what sort of a type he is, how I understand him, that is? To begin with, he is still a child and not exactly a coward, but something by way of an artist. Really, don&rsquo;t laugh at my describing him so. He is innocent and responsive to influence. He has a heart, and is a fantastic fellow. He sings and dances, he tells stories, they say, so that people come from other villages to hear him.</p></div> </div>
