<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>At Sonia&rsquo;s entrance, Razumihin, who had been sitting on one of Raskolnikov&rsquo;s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to enter. Raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where Zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too familiar a place, he hurriedly motioned her to Razumihin&rsquo;s chair.</p><p>&ldquo;You sit here,&rdquo; he said to Razumihin, putting him on the sofa.</p><p>Sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two ladies. It was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them. At the thought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed Raskolnikov.</p></div> </div>
