Walk about a bit, you won&rsquo;t be able to walk too far. If anything happens, I have one request to make of you,&rdquo; he added, dropping his voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an awkward one, but important. If anything were to happen (though indeed I don&rsquo;t believe in it and think you quite incapable of it), yet in case you were taken during these forty or fifty hours with the notion of putting an end to the business in some other way, in some fantastic fashion&mdash;laying hands on yourself&mdash;(it&rsquo;s an absurd proposition, but you must forgive me for it) do leave a brief but precise note, only two lines, and mention the stone. It will be more generous. Come, till we meet! Good thoughts and sound decisions to you!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
