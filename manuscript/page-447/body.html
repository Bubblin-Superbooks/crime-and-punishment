I forgot to ask you; what proof is there that the box came from the old woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s been proved,&rdquo; said Razumihin with apparent reluctance, frowning. &ldquo;Koch recognised the jewel-case and gave the name of the owner, who proved conclusively that it was his.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad. Now another point. Did anyone see Nikolay at the time that Koch and Pestryakov were going upstairs at first, and is there no evidence about that?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Nobody did see him,&rdquo; Razumihin answered with vexation. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of it. Even Koch and Pestryakov did not notice them on their way upstairs, though, indeed, their evidence could not have been worth much.</p></div> </div>
