Why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it&rsquo;s no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well enough that I&rsquo;ve caught him and that he won&rsquo;t escape me.

But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants. A modern cultivated man would prefer prison to living with such strangers as our peasants. He-he! But that&rsquo;s all nonsense, and on the surface. It&rsquo;s not merely that he has nowhere to run to, he is <em>psychologically</em> unable to escape me, he-he! What an expression! Through a law of nature he can&rsquo;t escape me</p></div> </div>
