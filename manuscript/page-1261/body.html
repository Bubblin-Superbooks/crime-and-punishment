At the great closed gates of the house, a little man stood with his shoulder leaning against them, wrapped in a grey soldier&rsquo;s coat, with a copper Achilles helmet on his head. He cast a drowsy and indifferent glance at Svidrigaïlov. His face wore that perpetual look of peevish dejection, which is so sourly printed on all faces of Jewish race without exception. They both, Svidrigaïlov and Achilles, stared at each other for a few minutes without speaking. At last it struck Achilles as irregular for a man not drunk to be standing three steps from him, staring and not saying a word.</p><p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; he said, without moving or changing his position.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing, brother, good morning,&rdquo; answered Svidrigaïlov.</p><p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t the place.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am going to foreign parts, brother.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To foreign parts?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
