<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;N-no,&rdquo; answered Dounia, with more animation. &ldquo;I saw clearly that it was too na√Øvely expressed, and that perhaps he simply has no skill in writing... that is a true criticism, brother. I did not expect, indeed...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It is expressed in legal style, and sounds coarser than perhaps he intended. But I must disillusion you a little. There is one expression in the letter, one slander about me, and rather a contemptible one. I gave the money last night to the widow, a woman in consumption, crushed with trouble, and not &lsquo;on the pretext of the funeral,&rsquo; but simply to pay for the funeral, and not to the daughter&mdash;a young woman, as he writes, of notorious behaviour (whom I saw last night for the first time in my life)&mdash;but to the widow. In all this I see a too hasty desire to slander me and to raise dissension between us.</p></div> </div>
