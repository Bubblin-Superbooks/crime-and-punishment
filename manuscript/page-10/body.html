<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Though neither by temperament nor conviction a revolutionist, Dostoevsky was one of a little group of young men who met together to read Fourier and Proudhon. He was accused of &ldquo;taking part in conversations against the censorship, of reading a letter from Byelinsky to Gogol, and of knowing of the intention to set up a printing press.&rdquo; Under Nicholas I. (that &ldquo;stern and just man,&rdquo; as Maurice Baring calls him) this was enough, and he was condemned to death. After eight months&rsquo; imprisonment he was with twenty-one others taken out to the Semyonovsky Square to be shot. Writing to his brother Mihail, Dostoevsky says: &ldquo;They snapped words over our heads, and they made us put on the white shirts worn by persons condemned to death. Thereupon we were bound in threes to stakes, to suffer execution. Being the third in the row, I concluded I had only a few minutes of life before me.</p></div> </div>
