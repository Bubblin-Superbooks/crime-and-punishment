Lebeziatnikov was moving to the door. Pyotr Petrovitch signed to Sonia to remain seated and stopped Lebeziatnikov.</p><p>&ldquo;Is Raskolnikov in there? Has he come?&rdquo; he asked him in a whisper.</p><p>&ldquo;Raskolnikov? Yes. Why? Yes, he is there. I saw him just come in.... Why?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, I particularly beg you to remain here with us and not to leave me alone with this... young woman. I only want a few words with her, but God knows what they may make of it. I shouldn&rsquo;t like Raskolnikov to repeat anything.... You understand what I mean?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
