She made her criticism quietly and earnestly. &ldquo;Where is it,&rdquo; thought Raskolnikov. &ldquo;Where is it I&rsquo;ve read that someone condemned to death says or thinks, an hour before his death, that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a narrow ledge that he&rsquo;d only room to stand, and the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude, everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain standing on a square yard of space all his life, a thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so than to die at once! Only to live, to live and live! Life, whatever it may be!... How true it is! Good God, how true! Man is a vile creature!... And vile is he who calls him vile for that,&rdquo; he added a moment later.</p></div> </div>
