You&rsquo;ll agree it&rsquo;s an occupation of a sort.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing to rejoice at, it&rsquo;s a disease and a dangerous one.&rdquo;</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s what you think, is it! I agree, that it is a disease like everything that exceeds moderation. And, of course, in this one must exceed moderation.
