Katerina Ivanovna determined now to invite this lady and her daughter, &ldquo;whose foot she was not worth,&rdquo; and who had turned away haughtily when she casually met them, so that they might know that &ldquo;she was more noble in her thoughts and feelings and did not harbour malice,&rdquo; and might see that she was not accustomed to her way of living. She had proposed to make this clear to them at dinner with allusions to her late father&rsquo;s governorship, and also at the same time to hint that it was exceedingly stupid of them to turn away on meeting her.</p></div> </div>
