<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> That horrid, military, Pushkin expression is unthinkable in the dictionary of the future. What does it mean indeed? It&rsquo;s nonsense, there will be no deception in a free marriage! That is only the natural consequence of a legal marriage, so to say, its corrective, a protest. So that indeed it&rsquo;s not humiliating... and if I ever, to suppose an absurdity, were to be legally married, I should be positively glad of it. I should say to my wife: &lsquo;My dear, hitherto I have loved you, now I respect you, for you&rsquo;ve shown you can protest!&rsquo; You laugh! That&rsquo;s because you are incapable of getting away from prejudices. Confound it all! I understand now where the unpleasantness is of being deceived in a legal marriage, but it&rsquo;s simply a despicable consequence of a despicable position in which both are humiliated.</p></div> </div>
