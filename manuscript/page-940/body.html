<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">without this &ldquo;serviceable and magnanimous man.&rdquo; It was one of Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s characteristics to paint everyone she met in the most glowing colours. Her praises were so exaggerated as sometimes to be embarrassing; she would invent various circumstances to the credit of her new acquaintance and quite genuinely believe in their reality. Then all of a sudden she would be disillusioned and would rudely and contemptuously repulse the person she had only a few hours before been literally adoring. She was naturally of a gay, lively and peace-loving disposition, but from continual failures and misfortunes she had come to desire so <em>keenly</em> that all should live in peace and joy and should not <em>dare</em> to break the peace, that the slightest jar, the smallest disaster reduced her almost to frenzy, and she would pass in an instant from the brightest hopes and fancies to cursing her fate and raving, and knocking her head against the wall.</p></div> </div>
