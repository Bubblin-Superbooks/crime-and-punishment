<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Why, I know one case in which a hypochondriac, a man of forty, cut the throat of a little boy of eight, because he couldn&rsquo;t endure the jokes he made every day at table! And in this case his rags, the insolent police officer, the fever and this suspicion! All that working upon a man half frantic with hypochondria, and with his morbid exceptional vanity! That may well have been the starting-point of illness. Well, bother it all!... And, by the way, that Zametov certainly is a nice fellow, but hm... he shouldn&rsquo;t have told all that last night. He is an awful chatterbox!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;But whom did he tell it to? You and me?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
