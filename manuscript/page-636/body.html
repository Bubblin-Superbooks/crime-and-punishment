Raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.</p><p>&ldquo;You seem to be jeering at me, brother?&rdquo; he said to him, with a well-feigned irritability. &ldquo;I dare say I do seem to you absurdly anxious about such trash; but you mustn&rsquo;t think me selfish or grasping for that, and these two things may be anything but trash in my eyes. I told you just now that the silver watch, though it&rsquo;s not worth a cent, is the only thing left us of my father&rsquo;s. You may laugh at me, but my mother is here,&rdquo; he turned suddenly to Porfiry, &ldquo;and if she knew,&rdquo; he turned again hurriedly to Razumihin, carefully making his voice tremble, &ldquo;that the watch was lost, she would be in despair! You know what women are!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
