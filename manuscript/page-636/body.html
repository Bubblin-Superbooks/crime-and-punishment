<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Avdotya Romanovna was remarkably good-looking; she was tall, strikingly well-proportioned, strong and self-reliant&mdash;the latter quality was apparent in every gesture, though it did not in the least detract from the grace and softness of her movements. In face she resembled her brother, but she might be described as really beautiful. Her hair was dark brown, a little lighter than her brother&rsquo;s; there was a proud light in her almost black eyes and yet at times a look of extraordinary kindness. She was pale, but it was a healthy pallor; her face was radiant with freshness and vigour. Her mouth was rather small; the full red lower lip projected a little as did her chin; it was the only irregularity in her beautiful face, but it gave it a peculiarly individual and almost haughty expression.</p></div> </div>
