Mr. Zametov there saw it. I say, Mr. Zametov, was I sensible or delirious yesterday; settle our dispute.&rdquo;</p><p>He could have strangled Zametov at that moment, so hateful were his expression and his silence to him.</p><p>&ldquo;In my opinion you talked sensibly and even artfully, but you were extremely irritable,&rdquo; Zametov pronounced dryly.</p><p>&ldquo;And Nikodim Fomitch was telling me to-day,&rdquo; put in Porfiry Petrovitch, &ldquo;that he met you very late last night in the lodging of a man who had been run over.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
