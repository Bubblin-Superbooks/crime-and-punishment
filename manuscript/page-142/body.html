On whom is she reckoning then? Is she counting on what is left of her hundred and twenty roubles of pension when Afanasy Ivanovitch&rsquo;s debt is paid? She knits woollen shawls and embroiders cuffs, ruining her old eyes. And all her shawls don&rsquo;t add more than twenty roubles a year to her hundred and twenty, I know that. So she is building all her hopes all the time on Mr. Luzhin&rsquo;s generosity; &lsquo;he will offer it of himself, he will press it on me.&rsquo; You may wait a long time for that! That&rsquo;s how it always is with these Schilleresque noble hearts;</p></div> </div>
