<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Do they know about the flat? If only they&rsquo;d make haste! When I said that I ran away to take a flat he let it pass.... I put that in cleverly about a flat, it may be of use afterwards.... Delirious, indeed... ha-ha-ha! He knows all about last night! He didn&rsquo;t know of my mother&rsquo;s arrival! The hag had written the date on in pencil! You are wrong, you won&rsquo;t catch me! There are no facts... it&rsquo;s all supposition! You produce facts! The flat even isn&rsquo;t a fact but delirium. I know what to say to them.... Do they know about the flat? I won&rsquo;t go without finding out. What did I come for? But my being angry now, maybe is a fact! Fool, how irritable I am! Perhaps that&rsquo;s right; to play the invalid.... He is feeling me. He will try to catch me. Why did I come?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
