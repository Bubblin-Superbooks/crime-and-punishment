Come to me, make haste,&rdquo; she turned from one to the other. &ldquo;Send for the doctor! Oh, dear!&rdquo;</p><p>Thanks to the official&rsquo;s efforts, this plan was adopted, the policeman even helping to carry Katerina Ivanovna. She was carried to Sonia&rsquo;s room, almost unconscious, and laid on the bed. The blood was still flowing, but she seemed to be coming to herself. Raskolnikov, Lebeziatnikov, and the official accompanied Sonia into the room and were followed by the policeman, who first drove back the crowd which followed to the very door. Polenka came in holding Kolya and Lida, who were trembling and weeping. Several persons came in too from the Kapernaumovs&rsquo; room;</p></div> </div>
