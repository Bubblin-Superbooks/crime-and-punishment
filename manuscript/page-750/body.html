<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I was quaking just now, for fear mother would ask to look at it, when we spoke of Dounia&rsquo;s watch. It is the only thing of father&rsquo;s left us. She would be ill if it were lost. You know what women are. So tell me what to do. I know I ought to have given notice at the police station, but would it not be better to go straight to Porfiry? Eh? What do you think? The matter might be settled more quickly. You see, mother may ask for it before dinner.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Certainly not to the police station. Certainly to Porfiry,&rdquo; Razumihin shouted in extraordinary excitement. &ldquo;Well, how glad I am. Let us go at once. It is a couple of steps. We shall be sure to find him.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
