And if the ear-rings being found in Nikolay&rsquo;s hands at the very day and hour of the murder constitutes an important piece of circumstantial evidence against him&mdash;although the explanation given by him accounts for it, and therefore it does not tell seriously against him&mdash;one must take into consideration the facts which prove him innocent, especially as they are facts that cannot be denied. And do you suppose, from the character of our legal system, that they will accept, or that they are in a position to accept, this fact&mdash;resting simply on a psychological impossibility&mdash;as irrefutable and conclusively breaking down the circumstantial evidence for the prosecution?
