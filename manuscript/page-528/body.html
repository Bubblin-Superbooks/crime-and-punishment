<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>I just ran in&mdash;to receive the guests. And if you weren&rsquo;t a fool, a common fool, a perfect fool, if you were an original instead of a translation... you see, Rodya, I recognise you&rsquo;re a clever fellow, but you&rsquo;re a fool!&mdash;and if you weren&rsquo;t a fool you&rsquo;d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone out, there&rsquo;s no help for it! I&rsquo;d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa&mdash;any way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
