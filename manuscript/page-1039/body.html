<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, I was...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, then it is a precedent for you for the future&mdash;though don&rsquo;t suppose I should venture to instruct you after the articles you publish about crime! No, I simply make bold to state it by way of fact, if I took this man or that for a criminal, why, I ask, should I worry him prematurely, even though I had evidence against him? In one case I may be bound, for instance, to arrest a man at once, but another may be in quite a different position, you know, so why shouldn&rsquo;t I let him walk about the town a bit? he-he-he! But I see you don&rsquo;t quite understand, so I&rsquo;ll give you a clearer example.</p></div> </div>
