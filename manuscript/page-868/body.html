<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Did you suppose I was such a monster, such a reactionary, such a slave driver? Ha, ha! By the way, do you remember, Rodion Romanovitch, how a few years ago, in those days of beneficent publicity, a nobleman, I&rsquo;ve forgotten his name, was put to shame everywhere, in all the papers, for having thrashed a German woman in the railway train. You remember? It was in those days, that very year I believe, the &lsquo;disgraceful action of the Age&rsquo; took place (you know, &lsquo;The Egyptian Nights,&rsquo; that public reading, you remember? The dark eyes, you know! Ah, the golden days of our youth, where are they?). Well, as for the gentleman who thrashed the German, I feel no sympathy with him, because after all what need is there for sympathy? But I must say that there are sometimes such provoking &lsquo;Germans&rsquo; that I don&rsquo;t believe there is a progressive who could quite answer for himself.</p></div> </div>
