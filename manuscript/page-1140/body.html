<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes... God will repay you for it,&rdquo; faltered Sonia, gazing intently at Pyotr Petrovitch.</p><p>&ldquo;It might be, but we will talk of it later. We might begin it to-day, we will talk it over this evening and lay the foundation so to speak. Come to me at seven o&rsquo;clock. Mr. Lebeziatnikov, I hope, will assist us. But there is one circumstance of which I ought to warn you beforehand and for which I venture to trouble you, Sofya Semyonovna, to come here. In my opinion money cannot be, indeed it&rsquo;s unsafe to put it into Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s own hands. The dinner to-day is a proof of that. Though she has not, so to speak, a crust of bread for to-morrow and... well, boots or shoes, or anything; she has bought to-day Jamaica rum, and even, I believe, Madeira and... and coffee. I saw it as I passed through. To-morrow it will all fall upon you again, they won&rsquo;t have a crust of bread.</p></div> </div>
