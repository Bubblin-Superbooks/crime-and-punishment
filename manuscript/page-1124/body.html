<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have you asked her to join your community?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You keep on laughing and very inappropriately, allow me to tell you. You don&rsquo;t understand! There is no such rôle in a community. The community is established that there should be no such rôles. In a community, such a rôle is essentially transformed and what is stupid here is sensible there, what, under present conditions, is unnatural becomes perfectly natural in the community. It all depends on the environment. It&rsquo;s all the environment and man himself is nothing. And I am on good terms with Sofya Semyonovna to this day, which is a proof that she never regarded me as having wronged her. I am trying now to attract her to the community, but on quite, quite a different footing. What are you laughing at? We are trying to establish a community of our own, a special one, on a broader basis. We have gone further in our convictions. We reject more! And meanwhile I&rsquo;m still developing Sofya Semyonovna. She has a beautiful, beautiful character!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
