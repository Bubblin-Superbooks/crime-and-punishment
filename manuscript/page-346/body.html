<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Not seeing anyone in the yard, he slipped in, and at once saw near the gate a sink, such as is often put in yards where there are many workmen or cab-drivers; and on the hoarding above had been scribbled in chalk the time-honoured witticism, &ldquo;Standing here strictly forbidden.&rdquo; This was all the better, for there would be nothing suspicious about his going in. &ldquo;Here I could throw it all in a heap and get away!&rdquo;</p><p>Looking round once more, with his hand already in his pocket, he noticed against the outer wall, between the entrance and the sink, a big unhewn stone, weighing perhaps sixty pounds. The other side of the wall was a street. He could hear passers-by, always numerous in that part, but he could not be seen from the entrance, unless someone came in from the street, which might well happen indeed, so there was need of haste.</p></div> </div>
