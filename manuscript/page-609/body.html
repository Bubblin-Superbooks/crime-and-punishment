How little did I think yesterday in the train that I could ever be glad of that.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I tell you again, mother, he is still very ill. Don&rsquo;t you see it? Perhaps worrying about us upset him. We must be patient, and much, much can be forgiven.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, you were not very patient!&rdquo; Pulcheria Alexandrovna caught her up, hotly and jealously. &ldquo;Do you know, Dounia, I was looking at you two. You are the very portrait of him, and not so much in face as in soul. You are both melancholy, both morose and hot-tempered, both haughty and both generous.... Surely he can&rsquo;t be an egoist, Dounia. Eh? When I think of what is in store for us this evening, my heart sinks!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy, mother. What must be, will be.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
