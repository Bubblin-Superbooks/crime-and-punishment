<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;There was no sort of noise or fighting in my house, Mr. Captain,&rdquo; she pattered all at once, like peas dropping, speaking Russian confidently, though with a strong German accent, &ldquo;and no sort of scandal, and his honour came drunk, and it&rsquo;s the whole truth I am telling, Mr. Captain, and I am not to blame.... Mine is an honourable house, Mr. Captain, and honourable behaviour, Mr. Captain, and I always, always dislike any scandal myself. But he came quite tipsy, and asked for three bottles again, and then he lifted up one leg, and began playing the pianoforte with one foot, and that is not at all right in an honourable house, and he ganz broke the piano, and it was very bad manners indeed and I said so. And he took up a bottle and began hitting everyone with it.</p></div> </div>
