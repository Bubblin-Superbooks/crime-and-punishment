<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You know, Terebyeva (who is in the community now) was blamed because when she left her family and... devoted... herself, she wrote to her father and mother that she wouldn&rsquo;t go on living conventionally and was entering on a free marriage and it was said that that was too harsh, that she might have spared them and have written more kindly. I think that&rsquo;s all nonsense and there&rsquo;s no need of softness; on the contrary, what&rsquo;s wanted is protest. Varents had been married seven years, she abandoned her two children, she told her husband straight out in a letter: &lsquo;I have realised that I cannot be happy with you. I can never forgive you that you have deceived me by concealing from me that there is another organisation of society by means of the communities. I have only lately learned it from a great-hearted man to whom I have given myself and with whom I am establishing a community.</p></div> </div>
