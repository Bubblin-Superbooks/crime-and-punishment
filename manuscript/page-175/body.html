<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Of course, I&rsquo;ve been meaning lately to go to Razumihin&rsquo;s to ask for work, to ask him to get me lessons or something...&rdquo; Raskolnikov thought, &ldquo;but what help can he be to me now? Suppose he gets me lessons, suppose he shares his last farthing with me, if he has any farthings, so that I could get some boots and make myself tidy enough to give lessons... hm... Well and what then? What shall I do with the few coppers I earn? That&rsquo;s not what I want now. It&rsquo;s really absurd for me to go to Razumihin....&rdquo;</p><p>The question why he was now going to Razumihin agitated him even more than he was himself aware; he kept uneasily seeking for some sinister significance in this apparently ordinary action.</p></div> </div>
