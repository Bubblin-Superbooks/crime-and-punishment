I&rsquo;ve given you a great promise, I am your betrothed. Trust me in this matter and, believe me, I shall be capable of judging impartially. My assuming the part of judge is as much a surprise for my brother as for you. When I insisted on his coming to our interview to-day after your letter, I told him nothing of what I meant to do. Understand that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you&mdash;it must be either you or he. That is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don&rsquo;t want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off with my brother, for my brother&rsquo;s sake I must break off with you. I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the husband for me.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
