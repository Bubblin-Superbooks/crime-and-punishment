<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">translation... you see, Rodya, I recognise you&rsquo;re a clever fellow, but you&rsquo;re a fool!&mdash;and if you weren&rsquo;t a fool you&rsquo;d come round to me this evening instead of wearing out your boots in the street! Since you have gone out, there&rsquo;s no help for it! I&rsquo;d give you a snug easy chair, my landlady has one... a cup of tea, company.... Or you could lie on the sofa&mdash;any way you would be with us.... Zossimov will be there too. Will you come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;R-rubbish!&rdquo; Razumihin shouted, out of patience. &ldquo;How do you know? You can&rsquo;t answer for yourself! You don&rsquo;t know anything about it.... Thousands of times I&rsquo;ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards.... One feels ashamed and goes back to a man! So remember, Potchinkov&rsquo;s house on the third storey....&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, Mr. Razumihin, I do believe you&rsquo;d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
