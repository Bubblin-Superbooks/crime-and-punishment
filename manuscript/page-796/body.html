Let&rsquo;s hear, please, how he will prove it!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He is always humbugging, confound him,&rdquo; cried Razumihin, jumping up and gesticulating. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of talking to you? He does all that on purpose; you don&rsquo;t know him, Rodion! He took their side yesterday, simply to make fools of them. And the things he said yesterday! And they were delighted! He can keep it up for a fortnight together. Last year he persuaded us that he was going into a monastery: he stuck to it for two months. Not long ago he took it into his head to declare he was going to get married, that he had everything ready for the wedding. He ordered new clothes indeed. We all began to congratulate him. There was no bride, nothing, all pure fantasy!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
