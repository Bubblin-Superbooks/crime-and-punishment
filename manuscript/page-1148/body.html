<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>It would be difficult to explain exactly what could have originated the idea of that senseless dinner in Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s disordered brain. Nearly ten of the twenty roubles, given by Raskolnikov for Marmeladov&rsquo;s funeral, were wasted upon it. Possibly Katerina Ivanovna felt obliged to honour the memory of the deceased &ldquo;suitably,&rdquo; that all the lodgers, and still more Amalia Ivanovna, might know &ldquo;that he was in no way their inferior, and perhaps very much their superior,&rdquo; and that no one had the right &ldquo;to turn up his nose at him.&rdquo; Perhaps the chief element was that peculiar &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s pride,&rdquo; which compels many poor people to spend their last savings on some traditional social ceremony, simply in order to do &ldquo;like other people,&rdquo; and not to &ldquo;be looked down upon.</p></div> </div>
