<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">the widow of a major, and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners required! I can&rsquo;t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where&rsquo;s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it, Sonia, where have you been? It&rsquo;s odd that even at your father&rsquo;s funeral you should be so unpunctual. Rodion Romanovitch, make room for her beside you. That&rsquo;s your place, Sonia... take what you like. Have some of the cold entr√©e with jelly, that&rsquo;s the best. They&rsquo;ll bring the pancakes directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got everything? (Cough-cough-cough.) That&rsquo;s all right. Be a good girl, Lida, and, Kolya, don&rsquo;t fidget with your feet; sit like a little gentleman. What are you saying, Sonia?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
