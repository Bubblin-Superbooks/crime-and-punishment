I&rsquo;m covered with blood,&rdquo; Raskolnikov said with a peculiar air; then he smiled, nodded and went downstairs.</p><p>He walked down slowly and deliberately, feverish but not conscious of it, entirely absorbed in a new overwhelming sensation of life and strength that surged up suddenly within him. This sensation might be compared to that of a man condemned to death who has suddenly been pardoned. Halfway down the staircase he was overtaken by the priest on his way home; Raskolnikov let him pass, exchanging a silent greeting with him. He was just descending the last steps when he heard rapid footsteps behind him. Someone overtook him; it was Polenka. She was running after him, calling &ldquo;Wait! wait!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
