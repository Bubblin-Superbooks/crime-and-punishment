Look into it more carefully and understand it! I too wanted to do good to men and would have done hundreds, thousands of good deeds to make up for that one piece of stupidity, not stupidity even, simply clumsiness, for the idea was by no means so stupid as it seems now that it has failed.... (Everything seems stupid when it fails.) By that stupidity I only wanted to put myself into an independent position, to take the first step, to obtain means, and then everything would have been smoothed over by benefits immeasurable in comparison.... But I... I couldn&rsquo;t carry out even the first step, because I am contemptible, that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s the matter! And yet I won&rsquo;t look at it as you do. If I had succeeded I should have been crowned with glory, but now I&rsquo;m trapped.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
