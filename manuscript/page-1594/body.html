Some sort of clerk not wearing a uniform was settling himself at a bureau to write. In a corner another clerk was seating himself. Zametov was not there, nor, of course, Nikodim Fomitch.</p><p>&ldquo;No one in?&rdquo; Raskolnikov asked, addressing the person at the bureau.</p><p>&ldquo;Whom do you want?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A-ah! Not a sound was heard, not a sight was seen, but I scent the Russian... how does it go on in the fairy tale... I&rsquo;ve forgotten! &lsquo;At your service!&rsquo;&rdquo; a familiar voice cried suddenly.</p></div> </div>
