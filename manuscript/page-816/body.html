Raskolnikov did not even raise his eyes to him.</p><p>&ldquo;I must admit,&rdquo; he went on calmly, &ldquo;that such cases certainly must arise. The vain and foolish are particularly apt to fall into that snare; young people especially.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, you see. Well then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo; Raskolnikov smiled in reply; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not my fault. So it is and so it always will be. He said just now (he nodded at Razumihin) that I sanction bloodshed. Society is too well protected by prisons, banishment, criminal investigators, penal servitude. There&rsquo;s no need to be uneasy. You have but to catch the thief.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
