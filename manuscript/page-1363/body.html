<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> What was it? Hm! I believe there is no need to go into that either. Those rumours and that accident led to one idea in my mind. I admit it openly&mdash;for one may as well make a clean breast of it&mdash;I was the first to pitch on you. The old woman&rsquo;s notes on the pledges and the rest of it&mdash;that all came to nothing. Yours was one of a hundred. I happened, too, to hear of the scene at the office, from a man who described it capitally, unconsciously reproducing the scene with great vividness. It was just one thing after another, Rodion Romanovitch, my dear fellow! How could I avoid being brought to certain ideas? From a hundred rabbits you can&rsquo;t make a horse, a hundred suspicions don&rsquo;t make a proof, as the English proverb says, but that&rsquo;s only from the rational point of view&mdash;you can&rsquo;t help being partial, for after all a lawyer is only human.</p></div> </div>
