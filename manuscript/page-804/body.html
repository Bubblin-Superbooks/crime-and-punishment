<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> well, legislators and leaders of men, such as Lycurgus, Solon, Mahomet, Napoleon, and so on, were all without exception criminals, from the very fact that, making a new law, they transgressed the ancient one, handed down from their ancestors and held sacred by the people, and they did not stop short at bloodshed either, if that bloodshed&mdash;often of innocent persons fighting bravely in defence of ancient law&mdash;were of use to their cause. It&rsquo;s remarkable, in fact, that the majority, indeed, of these benefactors and leaders of humanity were guilty of terrible carnage. In short, I maintain that all great men or even men a little out of the common, that is to say capable of giving some new word, must from their very nature be criminals&mdash;more or less, of course.</p></div> </div>
