I thought I should find you,&rdquo; he said, addressing Raskolnikov suddenly, &ldquo;that is, I didn&rsquo;t mean anything... of that sort... But I just thought... Katerina Ivanovna has gone out of her mind,&rdquo; he blurted out suddenly, turning from Raskolnikov to Sonia.</p><p>Sonia screamed.</p><p>&ldquo;At least it seems so. But... we don&rsquo;t know what to do, you see! She came back&mdash;she seems to have been turned out somewhere, perhaps beaten.... So it seems at least,... She had run to your father&rsquo;s former chief, she didn&rsquo;t find him at home: he was dining at some other general&rsquo;s.... Only fancy, she rushed off there, to the other general&rsquo;s, and, imagine, she was so persistent that she managed to get the chief to see her, had him fetched out from dinner, it seems.</p></div> </div>
