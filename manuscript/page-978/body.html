<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How is it she is so bold? She relies upon you?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, no, don&rsquo;t talk like that.... We are one, we live like one.&rdquo; Sonia was agitated again and even angry, as though a canary or some other little bird were to be angry. &ldquo;And what could she do? What, what could she do?&rdquo; she persisted, getting hot and excited. &ldquo;And how she cried to-day! Her mind is unhinged, haven&rsquo;t you noticed it? At one minute she is worrying like a child that everything should be right to-morrow, the lunch and all that.... Then she is wringing her hands, spitting blood, weeping, and all at once she will begin knocking her head against the wall, in despair. Then she will be comforted again.</p></div> </div>
