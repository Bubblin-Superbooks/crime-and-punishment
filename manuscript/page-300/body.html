No one who had no suspicion could distinguish anything. Nastasya from a distance could not have noticed, thank God!&rdquo; Then with a tremor he broke the seal of the notice and began reading; he was a long while reading, before he understood.

I never have anything to do with the police! And why just to-day?&rdquo; he thought in agonising bewilderment. &ldquo;Good God, only get it over soon!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
