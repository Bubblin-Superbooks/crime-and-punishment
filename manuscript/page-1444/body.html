<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I could never have believed that I could be moved to such a frenzy. It was essential, indeed, to be reconciled, but by then it was impossible. And imagine what I did then! To what a pitch of stupidity a man can be brought by frenzy! Never undertake anything in a frenzy, Rodion Romanovitch. I reflected that Avdotya Romanovna was after all a beggar (ach, excuse me, that&rsquo;s not the word... but does it matter if it expresses the meaning?), that she lived by her work, that she had her mother and you to keep (ach, hang it, you are frowning again), and I resolved to offer her all my money&mdash;thirty thousand roubles I could have realised then&mdash;if she would run away with me here, to Petersburg. Of course I should have vowed eternal love, rapture, and so on.</p></div> </div>
