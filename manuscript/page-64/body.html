<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent stretch-last-line">Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner&mdash;soup and salt meat with horse radish&mdash;which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she&rsquo;d anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with nothing at all, she&rsquo;d done her hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money &lsquo;for the time,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it won&rsquo;t do for me to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.&rsquo; Do you hear, do you hear? I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting, whispering together. &lsquo;Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again,</p></div> </div>
