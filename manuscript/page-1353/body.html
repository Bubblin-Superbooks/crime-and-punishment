<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Sit down, Porfiry Petrovitch, sit down.&rdquo; Raskolnikov gave his visitor a seat with so pleased and friendly an expression that he would have marvelled at himself, if he could have seen it.</p><p>The last moment had come, the last drops had to be drained! So a man will sometimes go through half an hour of mortal terror with a brigand, yet when the knife is at his throat at last, he feels no fear.</p><p>Raskolnikov seated himself directly facing Porfiry, and looked at him without flinching. Porfiry screwed up his eyes and began lighting a cigarette.</p><p>&ldquo;Speak, speak,&rdquo; seemed as though it would burst from Raskolnikov&rsquo;s heart. &ldquo;Come, why don&rsquo;t you speak?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
