<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I asked you for one thing, I came to you for one thing&mdash;not to leave me. You won&rsquo;t leave me, Sonia?&rdquo;</p><p>She squeezed his hand.</p><p>&ldquo;And why, why did I tell her? Why did I let her know?&rdquo; he cried a minute later in despair, looking with infinite anguish at her. &ldquo;Here you expect an explanation from me, Sonia; you are sitting and waiting for it, I see that. But what can I tell you? You won&rsquo;t understand and will only suffer misery... on my account! Well, you are crying and embracing me again. Why do you do it? Because I couldn&rsquo;t bear my burden and have come to throw it on another: you suffer too, and I shall feel better! And can you love such a mean wretch?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
