<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> dozens of families saved from destitution, from ruin, from vice, from the Lock hospitals&mdash;and all with her money. Kill her, take her money and with the help of it devote oneself to the service of humanity and the good of all. What do you think, would not one tiny crime be wiped out by thousands of good deeds? For one life thousands would be saved from corruption and decay. One death, and a hundred lives in exchange&mdash;it&rsquo;s simple arithmetic! Besides, what value has the life of that sickly, stupid, ill-natured old woman in the balance of existence! No more than the life of a louse, of a black-beetle, less in fact because the old woman is doing harm. She is wearing out the lives of others; the other day she bit Lizaveta&rsquo;s finger out of spite; it almost had to be amputated.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
