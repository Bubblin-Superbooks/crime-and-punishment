You have slept more than six hours.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Have I?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And why not? It will do you good. What&rsquo;s the hurry? A tryst, is it? We&rsquo;ve all time before us. I&rsquo;ve been waiting for the last three hours for you; I&rsquo;ve been up twice and found you asleep. I&rsquo;ve called on Zossimov twice; not at home, only fancy! But no matter, he will turn up. And I&rsquo;ve been out on my own business, too. You know I&rsquo;ve been moving to-day, moving with my uncle. I have an uncle living with me now.</p></div> </div>
