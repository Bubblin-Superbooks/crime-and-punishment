<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This sum (now I can explain it all to you, my precious Rodya) she took chiefly in order to send you sixty roubles, which you needed so terribly then and which you received from us last year. We deceived you then, writing that this money came from Dounia&rsquo;s savings, but that was not so, and now I tell you all about it, because, thank God, things have suddenly changed for the better, and that you may know how Dounia loves you and what a heart she has. At first indeed Mr. Svidriga√Ølov treated her very rudely and used to make disrespectful and jeering remarks at table.... But I don&rsquo;t want to go into all those painful details, so as not to worry you for nothing when it is now all over.</p></div> </div>
