You know it&rsquo;s a question of money and, as I told you, I have plenty to spare. I will put those two little ones and Polenka into some good orphan asylum, and I will settle fifteen hundred roubles to be paid to each on coming of age, so that Sofya Semyonovna need have no anxiety about them. And I will pull her out of the mud too, for she is a good girl, isn&rsquo;t she? So tell Avdotya Romanovna that that is how I am spending her ten thousand.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What is your motive for such benevolence?&rdquo; asked Raskolnikov.</p></div> </div>
