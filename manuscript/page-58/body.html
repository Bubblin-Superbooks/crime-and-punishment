I don&rsquo;t condemn her for it, I don&rsquo;t blame her, for the one thing left her is recollection of the past, and all the rest is dust and ashes. Yes, yes, she is a lady of spirit, proud and determined. She scrubs the floors herself and has nothing but black bread to eat, but won&rsquo;t allow herself to be treated with disrespect. That&rsquo;s why she would not overlook Mr. Lebeziatnikov&rsquo;s rudeness to her, and so when he gave her a beating for it, she took to her bed more from the hurt to her feelings than from the blows. She was a widow when I married her, with three children, one smaller than the other. She married her first husband, an infantry officer, for love, and ran away with him from her father&rsquo;s house.</p></div> </div>
