<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But beggary, honoured sir, beggary is a vice. In poverty you may still retain your innate nobility of soul, but in beggary&mdash;never&mdash;no one. For beggary a man is not chased out of human society with a stick, he is swept out with a broom, so as to make it as humiliating as possible; and quite right, too, forasmuch as in beggary I am ready to be the first to humiliate myself. Hence the pot-house! Honoured sir, a month ago Mr. Lebeziatnikov gave my wife a beating, and my wife is a very different matter from me! Do you understand? Allow me to ask you another question out of simple curiosity: have you ever spent a night on a hay barge, on the Neva?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I have not happened to,&rdquo; answered Raskolnikov. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
