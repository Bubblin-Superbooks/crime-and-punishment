<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>ve argued it all over with myself, every point of it, and I know it all, all! And how sick, how sick I was then of going over it all! I have kept wanting to forget it and make a new beginning, Sonia, and leave off thinking. And you don&rsquo;t suppose that I went into it headlong like a fool? I went into it like a wise man, and that was just my destruction. And you mustn&rsquo;t suppose that I didn&rsquo;t know, for instance, that if I began to question myself whether I had the right to gain power&mdash;I certainly hadn&rsquo;t the right&mdash;or that if I asked myself whether a human being is a louse it proved that it wasn&rsquo;t so for me, though it might be for a man who would go straight to his goal without asking questions.... If I worried myself all those days, wondering whether Napoleon would have done it or not, I felt clearly of course that I wasn&rsquo;t Napoleon.</p></div> </div>
