<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The vast mass of mankind is mere material, and only exists in order by some great effort, by some mysterious process, by means of some crossing of races and stocks, to bring into the world at last perhaps one man out of a thousand with a spark of independence. One in ten thousand perhaps&mdash;I speak roughly, approximately&mdash;is born with some independence, and with still greater independence one in a hundred thousand. The man of genius is one of millions, and the great geniuses, the crown of humanity, appear on earth perhaps one in many thousand millions. In fact I have not peeped into the retort in which all this takes place. But there certainly is and must be a definite law, it cannot be a matter of chance.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, are you both joking?&rdquo; Razumihin cried at last. &ldquo;There you sit, making fun of one another. Are you serious, Rodya?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
