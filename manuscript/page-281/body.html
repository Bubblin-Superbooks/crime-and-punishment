<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Though he was almost falling from fatigue, he went a long way round so as to get home from quite a different direction.</p><p>He was not fully conscious when he passed through the gateway of his house! He was already on the staircase before he recollected the axe. And yet he had a very grave problem before him, to put it back and to escape observation as far as possible in doing so. He was of course incapable of reflecting that it might perhaps be far better not to restore the axe at all, but to drop it later on in somebody&rsquo;s yard. But it all happened fortunately, the door of the porter&rsquo;s room was closed but not locked, so that it seemed most likely that the porter was at home. But he had so completely lost all power of reflection that he walked straight to the door and opened it. If the porter had asked him, &ldquo;What do you want?&rdquo; he would perhaps have simply handed him the axe.</p></div> </div>
