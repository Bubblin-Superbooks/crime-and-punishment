There&rsquo;s no practicality.&rdquo; Razumihin flew at him. &ldquo;Practicality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven. And for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life. Ideas, if you like, are fermenting,&rdquo; he said to Pyotr Petrovitch, &ldquo;and desire for good exists, though it&rsquo;s in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands. Anyway, there&rsquo;s no practicality. Practicality goes well shod.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree with you,&rdquo; Pyotr Petrovitch replied, with evident enjoyment. &ldquo;Of course, people do get carried away and make mistakes, but one must have indulgence; those mistakes are merely evidence of enthusiasm for the cause and of abnormal external environment.</p></div> </div>
