<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This is the point, this is all: when you went up the stairs it was past seven, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Raskolnikov, with an unpleasant sensation at the very moment he spoke that he need not have said it.</p><p>&ldquo;Then when you went upstairs between seven and eight, didn&rsquo;t you see in a flat that stood open on a second storey, do you remember? two workmen or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn&rsquo;t you notice them? It&rsquo;s very, very important for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Painters? No, I didn&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything.</p></div> </div>
