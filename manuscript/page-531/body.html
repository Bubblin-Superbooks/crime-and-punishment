Then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.</p><p>&ldquo;Confound it,&rdquo; he went on almost aloud. &ldquo;He talked sensibly but yet... I am a fool! As if madmen didn&rsquo;t talk sensibly! And this was just what Zossimov seemed afraid of.&rdquo; He struck his finger on his forehead. &ldquo;What if... how could I let him go off alone? He may drown himself.... Ach, what a blunder! I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo; And he ran back to overtake Raskolnikov, but there was no trace of him. With a curse he returned with rapid steps to the Palais de Cristal to question Zametov.</p></div> </div>
