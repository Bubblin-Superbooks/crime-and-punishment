Confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?&rdquo; he added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him.</p><p>&ldquo;It is very possible,&rdquo; answered Raskolnikov coldly.</p><p>&ldquo;I should say, too,&rdquo; continued Zossimov with zest, &ldquo;that your complete recovery depends solely on yourself. Now that one can talk to you, I should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from bad to worse. These fundamental causes I don&rsquo;t know, but they must be known to you. You are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course. I fancy the first stage of your derangement coincides with your leaving the university.</p></div> </div>
