<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> The first morning I came back from the office I found Katerina Ivanovna had cooked two courses for dinner&mdash;soup and salt meat with horse radish&mdash;which we had never dreamed of till then. She had not any dresses... none at all, but she got herself up as though she were going on a visit; and not that she&rsquo;d anything to do it with, she smartened herself up with nothing at all, she&rsquo;d done her hair nicely, put on a clean collar of some sort, cuffs, and there she was, quite a different person, she was younger and better looking. Sonia, my little darling, had only helped with money &lsquo;for the time,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it won&rsquo;t do for me to come and see you too often. After dark maybe when no one can see.</p></div> </div>
