The steps of the man above had died away. &ldquo;So he must have stopped or hidden somewhere.&rdquo; He reached the third storey, should he go on? There was a stillness that was dreadful.... But he went on. The sound of his own footsteps scared and frightened him. How dark it was! The man must be hiding in some corner here. Ah! the flat was standing wide open, he hesitated and went in. It was very dark and empty in the passage, as though everything had been removed; he crept on tiptoe into the parlour which was flooded with moonlight. Everything there was as before, the chairs, the looking-glass, the yellow sofa and the pictures in the frames. A huge, round, copper-red moon looked in at the windows. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the moon that makes it so still, weaving some mystery,&rdquo; thought Raskolnikov.</p></div> </div>
