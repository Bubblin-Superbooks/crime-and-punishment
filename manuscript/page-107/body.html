<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> When you wrote to me two months ago that you had heard that Dounia had a great deal to put up with in the Svidrigra√Ølovs&rsquo; house, when you wrote that and asked me to tell you all about it&mdash;what could I write in answer to you? If I had written the whole truth to you, I dare say you would have thrown up everything and have come to us, even if you had to walk all the way, for I know your character and your feelings, and you would not let your sister be insulted. I was in despair myself, but what could I do? And, besides, I did not know the whole truth myself then. What made it all so difficult was that Dounia received a hundred roubles in advance when she took the place as governess in their family, on condition of part of her salary being deducted every month, and so it was impossible to throw up the situation without repaying the debt.</p></div> </div>
