<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been quite well.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I heard that too. I heard, indeed, that you were in great distress about something. You look pale still.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I am not pale at all.... No, I am quite well,&rdquo; Raskolnikov snapped out rudely and angrily, completely changing his tone. His anger was mounting, he could not repress it. &ldquo;And in my anger I shall betray myself,&rdquo; flashed through his mind again. &ldquo;Why are they torturing me?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not quite well!&rdquo; Razumihin caught him up. &ldquo;What next! He was unconscious and delirious all yesterday. Would you believe, Porfiry, as soon as our backs were turned, he dressed, though he could hardly stand, and gave us the slip and went off on a spree somewhere till midnight, delirious all the time! Would you believe it! Extraordinary!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
