And I was hoping to get some money!&rdquo; cried the young man.</p><p>&ldquo;We must give it up, of course, but what did she fix this time for? The old witch fixed the time for me to come herself. It&rsquo;s out of my way. And where the devil she can have got to, I can&rsquo;t make out. She sits here from year&rsquo;s end to year&rsquo;s end, the old hag; her legs are bad and yet here all of a sudden she is out for a walk!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better ask the porter?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where she&rsquo;s gone and when she&rsquo;ll be back.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Hm.... Damn it all!... We might ask.... But you know she never does go anywhere.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
