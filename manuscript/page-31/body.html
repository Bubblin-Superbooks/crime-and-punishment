<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You come with such trifles, my good sir, it&rsquo;s scarcely worth anything. I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler&rsquo;s for a rouble and a half.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father&rsquo;s. I shall be getting some money soon.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;A rouble and a half!&rdquo; cried the young man.</p><p>&ldquo;Please yourself&rdquo;&mdash;and the old woman handed him back the watch. The young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming.</p><p>&ldquo;Hand it over,&rdquo; he said roughly.</p></div> </div>
