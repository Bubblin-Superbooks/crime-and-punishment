I gave them all my money... and besides I&rsquo;ve just been kissed by someone who, if I had killed anyone, would just the same... in fact I saw someone else there... with a flame-coloured feather... but I am talking nonsense; I am very weak, support me... we shall be at the stairs directly...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; Razumihin asked anxiously.</p><p>&ldquo;I am a little giddy, but that&rsquo;s not the point, I am so sad, so sad... like a woman. Look, what&rsquo;s that?
