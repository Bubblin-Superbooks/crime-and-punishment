<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> For that&rsquo;s Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s character, and when children cry, even from hunger, she falls to beating them at once. At six o&rsquo;clock I saw Sonia get up, put on her kerchief and her cape, and go out of the room and about nine o&rsquo;clock she came back. She walked straight up to Katerina Ivanovna and she laid thirty roubles on the table before her in silence. She did not utter a word, she did not even look at her, she simply picked up our big green drap de dames shawl (we have a shawl, made of drap de dames), put it over her head and face and lay down on the bed with her face to the wall; only her little shoulders and her body kept shuddering.... And I went on lying there, just as before....</p></div> </div>
