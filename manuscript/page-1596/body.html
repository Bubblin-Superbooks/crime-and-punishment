Rodion Ro&mdash;Ro&mdash;Rodionovitch, that&rsquo;s it, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Rodion Romanovitch.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, of course, Rodion Romanovitch! I was just getting at it. I made many inquiries about you. I assure you I&rsquo;ve been genuinely grieved since that... since I behaved like that... it was explained to me afterwards that you were a literary man... and a learned one too... and so to say the first steps... Mercy on us! What literary or scientific man does not begin by some originality of conduct! My wife and I have the greatest respect for literature, in my wife it&rsquo;s a genuine passion! Literature and art! If only a man is a gentleman, all the rest can be gained by talents, learning, good sense, genius.</p></div> </div>
