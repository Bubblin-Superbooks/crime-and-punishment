The elder now has begun influencing him, especially since he tried to hang himself. But he&rsquo;ll come and tell me all himself. You think he&rsquo;ll hold out? Wait a bit, he&rsquo;ll take his words back. I am waiting from hour to hour for him to come and abjure his evidence. I have come to like that Nikolay and am studying him in detail. And what do you think? He-he! He answered me very plausibly on some points, he obviously had collected some evidence and prepared himself cleverly. But on other points he is simply at sea, knows nothing and doesn&rsquo;t even suspect that he doesn&rsquo;t know!</p></div> </div>
