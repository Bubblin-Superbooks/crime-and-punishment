But on the fourth storey&rdquo; (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) &ldquo;I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna&rsquo;s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But painters... no, I don&rsquo;t remember that there were any painters, and I don&rsquo;t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; Razumihin shouted suddenly, as though he had reflected and realised. &ldquo;Why, it was on the day of the murder the painters were at work, and he was there three days before? What are you asking?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
