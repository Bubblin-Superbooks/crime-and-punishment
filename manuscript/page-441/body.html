What&rsquo;s the matter? What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; Razumihin, too, got up from his seat.</p><p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. All were silent for a while.</p><p>&ldquo;He must have waked from a dream,&rdquo; Razumihin said at last, looking inquiringly at Zossimov. The latter slightly shook his head.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, go on,&rdquo; said Zossimov. &ldquo;What next?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What next? As soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting Dmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to Dushkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him. He told a lie saying he found them in the street, and went off drinking.</p></div> </div>
