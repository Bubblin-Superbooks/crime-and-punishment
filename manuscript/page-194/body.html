Finish her off,&rdquo; shouted a third.</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you! Stand off,&rdquo; Mikolka screamed frantically; he threw down the shaft, stooped down in the cart and picked up an iron crowbar. &ldquo;Look out,&rdquo; he shouted, and with all his might he dealt a stunning blow at the poor mare. The blow fell; the mare staggered, sank back, tried to pull, but the bar fell again with a swinging blow on her back and she fell on the ground like a log.</p></div> </div>
