<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> How funny it was! I present myself&mdash;a landowner, a widower, of a well-known name, with connections, with a fortune. What if I am fifty and she is not sixteen? Who thinks of that? But it&rsquo;s fascinating, isn&rsquo;t it? It is fascinating, ha-ha! You should have seen how I talked to the papa and mamma. It was worth paying to have seen me at that moment. She comes in, curtseys, you can fancy, still in a short frock&mdash;an unopened bud! Flushing like a sunset&mdash;she had been told, no doubt. I don&rsquo;t know how you feel about female faces, but to my mind these sixteen years, these childish eyes, shyness and tears of bashfulness are better than beauty; and she is a perfect little picture, too. Fair hair in little curls, like a lamb&rsquo;s, full little rosy lips, tiny feet, a charmer!... Well, we made friends.</p></div> </div>
