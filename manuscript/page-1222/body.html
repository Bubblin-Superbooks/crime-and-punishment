I ask from curiosity,&rdquo; said Svidriga√Ølov, still standing where he was.</p><p>&ldquo;Inform, if you want to! Don&rsquo;t stir! Don&rsquo;t come nearer! I&rsquo;ll shoot! You poisoned your wife, I know; you are a murderer yourself!&rdquo; She held the revolver ready.</p><p>&ldquo;Are you so positive I poisoned Marfa Petrovna?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You did! You hinted it yourself; you talked to me of poison.... I know you went to get it... you had it in readiness.... It was your doing.... It must have been your doing.... Scoundrel!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Even if that were true, it would have been for your sake... you would have been the cause.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;You are lying! I hated you always, always....&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
