He raised himself on the sofa and looked at them with glittering eyes, but sank back on to the pillow at once and turned to the wall. Zossimov watched him intently.</p><p>&ldquo;Very good.... Going on all right,&rdquo; he said lazily. &ldquo;Has he eaten anything?&rdquo;</p><p>They told him, and asked what he might have.</p><p class="stretch-last-line">&ldquo;He may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; he&rsquo;d better not have meat either, and... but no need to tell you that!&rdquo; Razumihin and he looked at each other. &ldquo;No more medicine or anything.
