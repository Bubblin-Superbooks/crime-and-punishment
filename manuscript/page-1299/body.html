And you are silly, Sonia: what have we to eat? Tell me that. We have worried you enough, I won&rsquo;t go on so! Ah, Rodion Romanovitch, is that you?&rdquo; she cried, seeing Raskolnikov and rushing up to him. &ldquo;Explain to this silly girl, please, that nothing better could be done! Even organ-grinders earn their living, and everyone will see at once that we are different, that we are an honourable and bereaved family reduced to beggary.</p></div> </div>
