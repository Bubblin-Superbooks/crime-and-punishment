You see, Rodya, all sorts of things have been happening while you have been laid up. When you decamped in that rascally way without leaving your address, I felt so angry that I resolved to find you out and punish you. I set to work that very day. How I ran about making inquiries for you! This lodging of yours I had forgotten, though I never remembered it, indeed, because I did not know it; and as for your old lodgings, I could only remember it was at the Five Corners, Harlamov&rsquo;s house. I kept trying to find that Harlamov&rsquo;s house, and afterwards it turned out that it was not Harlamov&rsquo;s, but Buch&rsquo;s.</p></div> </div>
