<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent">second storey, do you remember? two workmen or at least one of them? They were painting there, didn&rsquo;t you notice them? It&rsquo;s very, very important for them.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Painters? No, I didn&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; Raskolnikov answered slowly, as though ransacking his memory, while at the same instant he was racking every nerve, almost swooning with anxiety to conjecture as quickly as possible where the trap lay and not to overlook anything. &ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t see them, and I don&rsquo;t think I noticed a flat like that open.... But on the fourth storey&rdquo; (he had mastered the trap now and was triumphant) &ldquo;I remember now that someone was moving out of the flat opposite Alyona Ivanovna&rsquo;s.... I remember... I remember it clearly. Some porters were carrying out a sofa and they squeezed me against the wall. But painters... no, I don&rsquo;t remember that there were any painters, and I don&rsquo;t think that there was a flat open anywhere, no, there wasn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
