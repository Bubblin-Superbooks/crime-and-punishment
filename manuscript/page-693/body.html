I simply don&rsquo;t understand it... and... and... it weighs upon me, indeed, because I don&rsquo;t understand it. I tell you so candidly.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be irritated.&rdquo; Zossimov forced himself to laugh. &ldquo;Assume that you are my first patient&mdash;well&mdash;we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in love with them. And, of course, I am not rich in patients.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
