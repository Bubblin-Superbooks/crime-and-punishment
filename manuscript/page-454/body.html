If I&rsquo;d been driving fast or had not shouted to him, but I was going quietly, not in a hurry. Everyone could see I was going along just like everybody else. A drunken man can&rsquo;t walk straight, we all know.... I saw him crossing the street, staggering and almost falling.

The horses are young and ready to take fright... they started, he screamed... that made them worse. That&rsquo;s how it happened!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just how it was,&rdquo; a voice in the crowd confirmed.</p><p>&ldquo;He shouted, that&rsquo;s true, he shouted three times,&rdquo; another voice declared.</p><p>&ldquo;Three times it was, we all heard it,&rdquo; shouted a third.</p></div> </div>
