Katerina Ivanovna told me to beg you... to be at the service... in the morning... at Mitrofanievsky... and then... to us... to her... to do her the honour... she told me to beg you...&rdquo; Sonia stammered and ceased speaking.</p><p>&ldquo;I will try, certainly, most certainly,&rdquo; answered Raskolnikov. He, too, stood up, and he, too, faltered and could not finish his sentence. &ldquo;Please sit down,&rdquo; he said, suddenly. &ldquo;I want to talk to you.
