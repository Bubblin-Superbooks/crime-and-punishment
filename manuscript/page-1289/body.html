Her eyes were bright and soft. He saw that she too had come to him with love.</p><p>&ldquo;Brother, now I know all, all. Dmitri Prokofitch has explained and told me everything. They are worrying and persecuting you through a stupid and contemptible suspicion.... Dmitri Prokofitch told me that there is no danger, and that you are wrong in looking upon it with such horror. I don&rsquo;t think so, and I fully understand how indignant you must be, and that that indignation may have a permanent effect on you. That&rsquo;s what I am afraid of. As for your cutting yourself off from us, I don&rsquo;t judge you, I don&rsquo;t venture to judge you, and forgive me for having blamed you for it.</p></div> </div>
