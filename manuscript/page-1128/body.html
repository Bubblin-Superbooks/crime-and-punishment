<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;We had a debate lately on the question: Has a member of the community the right to enter another member&rsquo;s room, whether man or woman, at any time... and we decided that he has!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It might be at an inconvenient moment, he-he!&rdquo;</p><p>Lebeziatnikov was really angry.</p><p>&ldquo;You are always thinking of something unpleasant,&rdquo; he cried with aversion. &ldquo;Tfoo! How vexed I am that when I was expounding our system, I referred prematurely to the question of personal privacy! It&rsquo;s always a stumbling-block to people like you, they turn it into ridicule before they understand it. And how proud they are of it, too! Tfoo! I&rsquo;ve often maintained that that question should not be approached by a novice till he has a firm faith in the system.</p></div> </div>
