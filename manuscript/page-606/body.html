Raskolnikov was the first to open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.</p><p>His mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him. Why had he never expected, never thought of them, though the news that they had started, were on their way and would arrive immediately, had been repeated to him only that day? They had spent that hour and a half plying Nastasya with questions. She was standing before them and had told them everything by now. They were beside themselves with alarm when they heard of his &ldquo;running away&rdquo; to-day, ill and, as they understood from her story, delirious! &ldquo;Good Heavens, what had become of him?&rdquo; Both had been weeping, both had been in anguish for that hour and a half.</p></div> </div>
