My only desire has been to be of service to you and your mother with my advice, in view of the renewed efforts which may certainly be anticipated from him. For my part it&rsquo;s my firm conviction, that he will end in a debtor&rsquo;s prison again. Marfa Petrovna had not the slightest intention of settling anything substantial on him, having regard for his children&rsquo;s interests, and, if she left him anything, it would only be the merest sufficiency, something insignificant and ephemeral, which would not last a year for a man of his habits.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
