I lay down for a nap after dinner and what do you think: though Katerina Ivanovna had quarrelled to the last degree with our landlady Amalia Fyodorovna only a week before, she could not resist then asking her in to coffee. For two hours they were sitting, whispering together. &lsquo;Semyon Zaharovitch is in the service again, now, and receiving a salary,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and he went himself to his excellency and his excellency himself came out to him, made all the others wait and led Semyon Zaharovitch by the hand before everybody into his study.&rsquo; Do you hear, do you hear? &lsquo;To be sure,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;Semyon Zaharovitch, remembering your past services,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;and in spite of your propensity to that foolish weakness, since you promise now and since moreover we&rsquo;ve got on badly without you,&rsquo; (do you hear, do you hear;) &lsquo;</p></div> </div>
