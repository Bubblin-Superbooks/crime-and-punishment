<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ach, Rodya, you have been upset again!... But what did he say, what did he come for?&rdquo;</p><p>Raskolnikov did not answer. Razumihin thought a minute.</p><p>&ldquo;Now let me tell you my story,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;I came to you, you were asleep. Then we had dinner and then I went to Porfiry&rsquo;s, Zametov was still with him. I tried to begin, but it was no use. I couldn&rsquo;t speak in the right way. They don&rsquo;t seem to understand and can&rsquo;t understand, but are not a bit ashamed. I drew Porfiry to the window, and began talking to him, but it was still no use. He looked away and I looked away. At last I shook my fist in his ugly face, and told him as a cousin I&rsquo;d brain him. He merely looked at me, I cursed and came away. That was all. It was very stupid. To Zametov I didn&rsquo;t say a word.</p></div> </div>
