I have only come to find out once for all whether it&rsquo;s a fact that you are mad? There is a conviction in the air that you are mad or very nearly so. I admit I&rsquo;ve been disposed to that opinion myself, judging from your stupid, repulsive and quite inexplicable actions, and from your recent behavior to your mother and sister. Only a monster or a madman could treat them as you have; so you must be mad.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
