Think it over, my dear fellow, and pray to God. It&rsquo;s more in your interest, believe me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And what if I run away?&rdquo; asked Raskolnikov with a strange smile.</p><p>&ldquo;No, you won&rsquo;t run away. A peasant would run away, a fashionable dissenter would run away, the flunkey of another man&rsquo;s thought, for you&rsquo;ve only to show him the end of your little finger and he&rsquo;ll be ready to believe in anything for the rest of his life. But you&rsquo;ve ceased to believe in your theory already, what will you run away with? And what would you do in hiding? It would be hateful and difficult for you, and what you need more than anything in life is a definite position, an atmosphere to suit you.</p></div> </div>
