But Svidrigaïlov restrained himself and answered very civilly:</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, it was. I see that you, too, are extremely interested and shall feel it my duty to satisfy your curiosity at the first opportunity. Upon my soul!

Judge how grateful I must be to Marfa Petrovna for having repeated to Avdotya Romanovna such mysterious and interesting gossip about me. I dare not guess what impression it made on her, but in any case it worked in my interests. With all Avdotya Romanovna&rsquo;s natural aversion and in spite of my invariably gloomy and repellent aspect&mdash;she did at least feel pity for me, pity for a lost soul. And if once a girl&rsquo;s heart is moved to pity, it&rsquo;s more dangerous than anything.</p></div> </div>
