The party consisted of the Pole, a wretched looking clerk with a spotty face and a greasy coat, who had not a word to say for himself, and smelt abominably, a deaf and almost blind old man who had once been in the post office and who had been from immemorial ages maintained by someone at Amalia Ivanovna&rsquo;s.</p><p>A retired clerk of the commissariat department came, too; he was drunk, had a loud and most unseemly laugh and only fancy&mdash;was without a waistcoat! One of the visitors sat straight down to the table without even greeting Katerina Ivanovna.</p></div> </div>
