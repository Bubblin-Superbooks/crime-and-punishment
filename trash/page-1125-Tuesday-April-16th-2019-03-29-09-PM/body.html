In fact, I feel it strange myself how timid, chaste and modern she is with me!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And you, of course, are developing her... he-he! trying to prove to her that all that modesty is nonsense?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all! How coarsely, how stupidly&mdash;excuse me saying so&mdash;you misunderstand the word development! Good heavens, how... crude you still are! We are striving for the freedom of women and you have only one idea in your head.... Setting aside the general question of chastity and feminine modesty as useless in themselves and indeed prejudices, I fully accept her chastity with me, because that&rsquo;s for her to decide.</p></div> </div>
