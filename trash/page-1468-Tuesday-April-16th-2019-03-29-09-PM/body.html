I understand the questions you are worrying over&mdash;moral ones, aren&rsquo;t they? Duties of citizen and man? Lay them all aside. They are nothing to you now, ha-ha! You&rsquo;ll say you are still a man and a citizen. If so you ought not to have got into this coil. It&rsquo;s no use taking up a job you are not fit for. Well, you&rsquo;d better shoot yourself, or don&rsquo;t you want to?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
