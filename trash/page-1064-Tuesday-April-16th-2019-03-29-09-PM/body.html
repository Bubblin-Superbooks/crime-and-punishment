<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What has that to do with you? How do you know it? What concern is it of yours? You are keeping watch on me and want to let me know it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Good heavens! Why, I learnt it all from you yourself! You don&rsquo;t notice that in your excitement you tell me and others everything. From Razumihin, too, I learnt a number of interesting details yesterday. No, you interrupted me, but I must tell you that, for all your wit, your suspiciousness makes you lose the common-sense view of things. To return to bell-ringing, for instance. I, an examining lawyer, have betrayed a precious thing like that, a real fact (for it is a fact worth having), and you see nothing in it! Why, if I had the slightest suspicion of you, should I have acted like that?</p></div> </div>
