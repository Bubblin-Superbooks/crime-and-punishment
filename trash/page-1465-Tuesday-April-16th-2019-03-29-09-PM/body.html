<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to your lodgings, not to see you but Sofya Semyonovna, to say I&rsquo;m sorry not to have been at the funeral.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you like, but Sofya Semyonovna is not at home. She has taken the three children to an old lady of high rank, the patroness of some orphan asylums, whom I used to know years ago. I charmed the old lady by depositing a sum of money with her to provide for the three children of Katerina Ivanovna and subscribing to the institution as well. I told her too the story of Sofya Semyonovna in full detail, suppressing nothing. It produced an indescribable effect on her. That&rsquo;s why Sofya Semyonovna has been invited to call to-day at the X. Hotel where the lady is staying for the time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
