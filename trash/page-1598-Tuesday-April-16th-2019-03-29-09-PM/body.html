<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No, I only looked in... I came to ask... I thought that I should find Zametov here.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! Of course, you&rsquo;ve made friends, I heard. Well, no, Zametov is not here. Yes, we&rsquo;ve lost Zametov. He&rsquo;s not been here since yesterday... he quarrelled with everyone on leaving... in the rudest way. He is a feather-headed youngster, that&rsquo;s all; one might have expected something from him, but there, you know what they are, our brilliant young men. He wanted to go in for some examination, but it&rsquo;s only to talk and boast about it, it will go no further than that. Of course it&rsquo;s a very different matter with you or Mr. Razumihin there, your friend. Your career is an intellectual one and you won&rsquo;t be deterred by failure. For you, one may say, all the attractions of life nihil est&mdash;you are an ascetic, a monk, a hermit!...</p></div> </div>
