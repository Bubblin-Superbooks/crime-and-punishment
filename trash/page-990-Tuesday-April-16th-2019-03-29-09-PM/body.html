<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It was not because of your dishonour and your sin I said that of you, but because of your great suffering. But you are a great sinner, that&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; he added almost solemnly, &ldquo;and your worst sin is that you have destroyed and betrayed yourself for nothing. Isn&rsquo;t that fearful? Isn&rsquo;t it fearful that you are living in this filth which you loathe so, and at the same time you know yourself (you&rsquo;ve only to open your eyes) that you are not helping anyone by it, not saving anyone from anything? Tell me,&rdquo; he went on almost in a frenzy, &ldquo;how this shame and degradation can exist in you side by side with other, opposite, holy feelings? It would be better, a thousand times better and wiser to leap into the water and end it all!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
