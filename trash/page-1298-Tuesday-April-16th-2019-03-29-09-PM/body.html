Polenka was in her everyday dress; she looked in timid perplexity at her mother, and kept at her side, hiding her tears. She dimly realised her mother&rsquo;s condition, and looked uneasily about her. She was terribly frightened of the street and the crowd. Sonia followed Katerina Ivanovna, weeping and beseeching her to return home, but Katerina Ivanovna was not to be persuaded.</p><p>&ldquo;Leave off, Sonia, leave off,&rdquo; she shouted, speaking fast, panting and coughing. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you ask; you are like a child! I&rsquo;ve told you before that I am not coming back to that drunken German.</p></div> </div>
