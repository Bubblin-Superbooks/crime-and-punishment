<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Raskolnikov had begun getting up. He felt oppressed and stifled and, as it were, ill at ease at having come here. He felt convinced that Svidrigaïlov was the most worthless scoundrel on the face of the earth.</p><p>&ldquo;A-ach! Sit down, stay a little!&rdquo; Svidrigaïlov begged. &ldquo;Let them bring you some tea, anyway. Stay a little, I won&rsquo;t talk nonsense, about myself, I mean. I&rsquo;ll tell you something. If you like I&rsquo;ll tell you how a woman tried &lsquo;to save&rsquo; me, as you would call it? It will be an answer to your first question indeed, for the woman was your sister. May I tell you? It will help to spend the time.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
