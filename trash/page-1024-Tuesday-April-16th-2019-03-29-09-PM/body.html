<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> On Raskolnikov&rsquo;s entrance Porfiry Petrovitch had at once closed the door by which he had come in and they remained alone. He met his visitor with an apparently genial and good-tempered air, and it was only after a few minutes that Raskolnikov saw signs of a certain awkwardness in him, as though he had been thrown out of his reckoning or caught in something very secret.</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow! Here you are... in our domain&rdquo;... began Porfiry, holding out both hands to him. &ldquo;Come, sit down, old man... or perhaps you don&rsquo;t like to be called &lsquo;my dear fellow&rsquo; and &lsquo;old man!&rsquo;&mdash;tout court? Please don&rsquo;t think it too familiar.... Here, on the sofa.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
