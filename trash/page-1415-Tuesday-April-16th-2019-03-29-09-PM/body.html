<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have I got to bother myself about you, too, now?&rdquo; said Raskolnikov suddenly, coming with nervous impatience straight to the point. &ldquo;Even though perhaps you are the most dangerous man if you care to injure me, I don&rsquo;t want to put myself out any more. I will show you at once that I don&rsquo;t prize myself as you probably think I do. I&rsquo;ve come to tell you at once that if you keep to your former intentions with regard to my sister and if you think to derive any benefit in that direction from what has been discovered of late, I will kill you before you get me locked up. You can reckon on my word. You know that I can keep it. And in the second place if you want to tell me anything&mdash;for I keep fancying all this time that you have something to tell me&mdash;make haste and tell it, for time is precious and very likely it will soon be too late.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
