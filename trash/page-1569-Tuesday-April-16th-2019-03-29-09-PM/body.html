Brother, what are you saying?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s not picturesque, not Ã¦sthetically attractive! I fail to understand why bombarding people by regular siege is more honourable. The fear of appearances is the first symptom of impotence. I&rsquo;ve never, never recognised this more clearly than now, and I am further than ever from seeing that what I did was a crime. I&rsquo;ve never, never been stronger and more convinced than now.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
