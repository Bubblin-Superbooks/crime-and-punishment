<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Who thrashed? Whom?&rdquo; cried Lebeziatnikov, flustered and blushing.</p><p>&ldquo;Why, you thrashed Katerina Ivanovna a month ago. I heard so yesterday... so that&rsquo;s what your convictions amount to... and the woman question, too, wasn&rsquo;t quite sound, he-he-he!&rdquo; and Pyotr Petrovitch, as though comforted, went back to clicking his beads.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all slander and nonsense!&rdquo; cried Lebeziatnikov, who was always afraid of allusions to the subject. &ldquo;It was not like that at all, it was quite different. You&rsquo;ve heard it wrong; it&rsquo;s a libel. I was simply defending myself. She rushed at me first with her nails, she pulled out all my whiskers.... It&rsquo;s permissable for anyone, I should hope, to defend himself and I never allow anyone to use violence to me on principle, for it&rsquo;s an act of despotism. What was I to do? I simply pushed her back.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
