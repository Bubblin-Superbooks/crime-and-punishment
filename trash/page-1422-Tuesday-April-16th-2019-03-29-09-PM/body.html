<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;You ask whether I find anything wrong in vice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Vice! Oh, that&rsquo;s what you are after! But I&rsquo;ll answer you in order, first about women in general; you know I am fond of talking. Tell me, what should I restrain myself for? Why should I give up women, since I have a passion for them? It&rsquo;s an occupation, anyway.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;So you hope for nothing here but vice?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, very well, for vice then. You insist on its being vice. But anyway I like a direct question. In this vice at least there is something permanent, founded indeed upon nature and not dependent on fantasy, something present in the blood like an ever-burning ember, for ever setting one on fire and, maybe, not to be quickly extinguished, even with years. You&rsquo;ll agree it&rsquo;s an occupation of a sort.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
