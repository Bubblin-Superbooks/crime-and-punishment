It makes me miserable.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He has just been to see me,&rdquo; said Raskolnikov, breaking his silence for the first time.</p><p>There were exclamations from all, and they all turned to him. Even Pyotr Petrovitch was roused.</p><p>&ldquo;An hour and a half ago, he came in when I was asleep, waked me, and introduced himself,&rdquo; Raskolnikov continued. &ldquo;He was fairly cheerful and at ease, and quite hopes that we shall become friends. He is particularly anxious, by the way, Dounia, for an interview with you, at which he asked me to assist. He has a proposition to make to you, and he told me about it. He told me, too, that a week before her death Marfa Petrovna left you three thousand roubles in her will, Dounia, and that you can receive the money very shortly.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
