<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> and have you noticed, Rodion Romanovitch, that in our Petersburg circles, if two clever men meet who are not intimate, but respect each other, like you and me, it takes them half an hour before they can find a subject for conversation&mdash;they are dumb, they sit opposite each other and feel awkward. Everyone has subjects of conversation, ladies for instance... people in high society always have their subjects of conversation, c&rsquo;est de rigueur, but people of the middle sort like us, thinking people that is, are always tongue-tied and awkward. What is the reason of it? Whether it is the lack of public interest, or whether it is we are so honest we don&rsquo;t want to deceive one another, I don&rsquo;t know. What do you think? Do put down your cap, it looks as if you were just going, it makes me uncomfortable... I am so delighted...&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
