<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Raskolnikov sat down, keeping his eyes fixed on him. &ldquo;In our domain,&rdquo; the apologies for familiarity, the French phrase tout court, were all characteristic signs.</p><p>&ldquo;He held out both hands to me, but he did not give me one&mdash;he drew it back in time,&rdquo; struck him suspiciously. Both were watching each other, but when their eyes met, quick as lightning they looked away.</p><p>&ldquo;I brought you this paper... about the watch. Here it is. Is it all right or shall I copy it again?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What? A paper? Yes, yes, don&rsquo;t be uneasy, it&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; Porfiry Petrovitch said as though in haste, and after he had said it he took the paper and looked at it. &ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s all right. Nothing more is needed,&rdquo; he declared with the same rapidity and he laid the paper on the table.</p></div> </div>
