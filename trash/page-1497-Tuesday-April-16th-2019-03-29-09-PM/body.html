So that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; he cried, surprised but smiling maliciously. &ldquo;Well, that completely alters the aspect of affairs. You&rsquo;ve made things wonderfully easier for me, Avdotya Romanovna. But where did you get the revolver? Was it Mr. Razumihin? Why, it&rsquo;s my revolver, an old friend! And how I&rsquo;ve hunted for it! The shooting lessons I&rsquo;ve given you in the country have not been thrown away.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your revolver, it belonged to Marfa Petrovna, whom you killed, wretch! There was nothing of yours in her house. I took it when I began to suspect what you were capable of. If you dare to advance one step, I swear I&rsquo;ll kill you.&rdquo; She was frantic.</p></div> </div>
