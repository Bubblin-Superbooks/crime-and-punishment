<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;When did you see them last?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Just now. Haven&rsquo;t you seen them since then? What have you been doing with yourself? Tell me, please. I&rsquo;ve been to you three times already. Your mother has been seriously ill since yesterday. She had made up her mind to come to you; Avdotya Romanovna tried to prevent her; she wouldn&rsquo;t hear a word. &lsquo;If he is ill, if his mind is giving way, who can look after him like his mother?&rsquo; she said. We all came here together, we couldn&rsquo;t let her come alone all the way. We kept begging her to be calm. We came in, you weren&rsquo;t here; she sat down, and stayed ten minutes, while we stood waiting in silence. She got up and said: &lsquo;If he&rsquo;s gone out, that is, if he is well, and has forgotten his mother, it&rsquo;s humiliating and unseemly for his mother to stand at his door begging for kindness.</p></div> </div>
