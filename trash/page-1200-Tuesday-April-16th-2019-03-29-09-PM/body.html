I know nothing about it,&rdquo; she cried with a heartrending wail, and she ran to Katerina Ivanovna, who clasped her tightly in her arms, as though she would shelter her from all the world.</p><p>&ldquo;Sonia! Sonia! I don&rsquo;t believe it! You see, I don&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo; she cried in the face of the obvious fact, swaying her to and fro in her arms like a baby, kissing her face continually, then snatching at her hands and kissing them, too, &ldquo;you took it! How stupid these people are! Oh dear! You are fools, fools,&rdquo; she cried, addressing the whole room, &ldquo;you don&rsquo;t know, you don&rsquo;t know what a heart she has, what a girl she is! She take it, she? She&rsquo;d sell her last rag, she&rsquo;d go barefoot to help you if you needed it, that&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
