But there was a look of sharp determination in his white face.</p><p>&ldquo;I meant to say... as I was coming here... I meant to tell you, mother, and you, Dounia, that it would be better for us to part for a time. I feel ill, I am not at peace.... I will come afterwards, I will come of myself... when it&rsquo;s possible. I remember you and love you.... Leave me, leave me alone. I decided this even before... I&rsquo;m absolutely resolved on it. Whatever may come to me, whether I come to ruin or not, I want to be alone. Forget me altogether, it&rsquo;s better. Don&rsquo;t inquire about me. When I can, I&rsquo;ll come of myself or... I&rsquo;ll send for you.</p></div> </div>
