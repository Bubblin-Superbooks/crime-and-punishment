<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I had to endure all the agony of that battle of ideas, Sonia, and I longed to throw it off: I wanted to murder without casuistry, to murder for my own sake, for myself alone! I didn&rsquo;t want to lie about it even to myself. It wasn&rsquo;t to help my mother I did the murder&mdash;that&rsquo;s nonsense&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t do the murder to gain wealth and power and to become a benefactor of mankind. Nonsense! I simply did it; I did the murder for myself, for myself alone, and whether I became a benefactor to others, or spent my life like a spider catching men in my web and sucking the life out of men, I couldn&rsquo;t have cared at that moment.... And it was not the money I wanted, Sonia, when I did it. It was not so much the money I wanted, but something else.... I know it all now.... Understand me! Perhaps I should never have committed a murder again.</p></div> </div>
