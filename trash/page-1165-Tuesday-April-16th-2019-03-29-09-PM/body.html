Have some of the cold entr√©e with jelly, that&rsquo;s the best. They&rsquo;ll bring the pancakes directly. Have they given the children some? Polenka, have you got everything? (Cough-cough-cough.)

What are you saying, Sonia?&rdquo;</p><p>Sonia hastened to give her Pyotr Petrovitch&rsquo;s apologies, trying to speak loud enough for everyone to hear and carefully choosing the most respectful phrases which she attributed to Pyotr Petrovitch.
