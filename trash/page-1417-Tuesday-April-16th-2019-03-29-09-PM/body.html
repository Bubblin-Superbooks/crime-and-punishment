<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;What did you want me, for, then? It was you who came hanging about me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why, simply as an interesting subject for observation. I liked the fantastic nature of your position&mdash;that&rsquo;s what it was! Besides you are the brother of a person who greatly interested me, and from that person I had in the past heard a very great deal about you, from which I gathered that you had a great influence over her; isn&rsquo;t that enough? Ha-ha-ha! Still I must admit that your question is rather complex, and is difficult for me to answer. Here, you, for instance, have come to me not only for a definite object, but for the sake of hearing something new. Isn&rsquo;t that so? Isn&rsquo;t that so?&rdquo; persisted Svidriga√Ølov with a sly smile.</p></div> </div>
