All the circumstances of their last interview suddenly came back to him, and he felt a rush of the feeling that had come upon him then.</p><p>&ldquo;I came to see you the day before yesterday, in the evening; you didn&rsquo;t know?&rdquo; Porfiry Petrovitch went on, looking round the room. &ldquo;I came into this very room. I was passing by, just as I did to-day, and I thought I&rsquo;d return your call.
