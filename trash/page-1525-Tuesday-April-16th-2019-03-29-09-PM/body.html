He felt a longing to fix his imagination on something. &ldquo;It must be a garden under the window,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sound of trees.

This reminded him of the bridge over the Little Neva and he felt cold again as he had when standing there. &ldquo;I never have liked water,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;even in a landscape,&rdquo; and he suddenly smiled again at a strange idea: &ldquo;Surely now all these questions of taste and comfort ought not to matter, but I&rsquo;ve become more particular, like an animal that picks out a special place... for such an occasion.</p></div> </div>
