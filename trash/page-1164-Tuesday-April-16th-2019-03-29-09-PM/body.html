<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Do you know, I gave her the most delicate instructions, so to speak, for inviting that lady and her daughter, you understand of whom I am speaking? It needed the utmost delicacy, the greatest nicety, but she has managed things so that that fool, that conceited baggage, that provincial nonentity, simply because she is the widow of a major, and has come to try and get a pension and to fray out her skirts in the government offices, because at fifty she paints her face (everybody knows it)... a creature like that did not think fit to come, and has not even answered the invitation, which the most ordinary good manners required! I can&rsquo;t understand why Pyotr Petrovitch has not come? But where&rsquo;s Sonia? Where has she gone? Ah, there she is at last! what is it, Sonia, where have you been? It&rsquo;s odd that even at your father&rsquo;s funeral you should be so unpunctual.</p></div> </div>
