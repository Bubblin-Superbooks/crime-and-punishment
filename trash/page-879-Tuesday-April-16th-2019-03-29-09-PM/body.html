<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;How do you mean &lsquo;she is pleased to visit you&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;She has been three times. I saw her first on the very day of the funeral, an hour after she was buried. It was the day before I left to come here. The second time was the day before yesterday, at daybreak, on the journey at the station of Malaya Vishera, and the third time was two hours ago in the room where I am staying. I was alone.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Were you awake?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Quite awake. I was wide awake every time. She comes, speaks to me for a minute and goes out at the door&mdash;always at the door. I can almost hear her.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
