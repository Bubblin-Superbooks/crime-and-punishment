You must have been at him day and night, proving to him that he was the murderer, and now that he has confessed, you&rsquo;ll begin vivisecting him again. &lsquo;You are lying,&rsquo; you&rsquo;ll say. &lsquo;You are not the murderer! You can&rsquo;t be! It&rsquo;s not your own tale you are telling!&rsquo; You must admit it&rsquo;s a comical business!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;He-he-he!
