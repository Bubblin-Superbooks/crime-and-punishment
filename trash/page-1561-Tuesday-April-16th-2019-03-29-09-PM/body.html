You&rsquo;ll come, you&rsquo;ll come to-morrow?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I will, I will, good-bye.&rdquo; He tore himself away at last.</p><p>It was a warm, fresh, bright evening; it had cleared up in the morning. Raskolnikov went to his lodgings; he made haste. He wanted to finish all before sunset. He did not want to meet anyone till then. Going up the stairs he noticed that Nastasya rushed from the samovar to watch him intently. &ldquo;Can anyone have come to see me?&rdquo; he wondered. He had a disgusted vision of Porfiry. But opening his door he saw Dounia. She was sitting alone, plunged in deep thought, and looked as though she had been waiting a long time. He stopped short in the doorway. She rose from the sofa in dismay and stood up facing him.</p></div> </div>
