As for what you&rsquo;ve alluded to in my letter, be so good as to point out one word of falsehood, show, that is, that you didn&rsquo;t throw away your money, and that there are not worthless persons in that family, however unfortunate.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;To my thinking, you, with all your virtues, are not worth the little finger of that unfortunate girl at whom you throw stones.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
