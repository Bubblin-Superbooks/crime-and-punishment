<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> H&rsquo;m! I have not much time, and can&rsquo;t stay long with you, it&rsquo;s a pity! I should have found plenty to tell you.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your engagement, a woman?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, a woman, a casual incident.... No, that&rsquo;s not what I want to talk of.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And the hideousness, the filthiness of all your surroundings, doesn&rsquo;t that affect you? Have you lost the strength to stop yourself?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And do you pretend to strength, too? He-he-he! You surprised me just now, Rodion Romanovitch, though I knew beforehand it would be so. You preach to me about vice and Ã¦sthetics! You&mdash;a Schiller, you&mdash;an idealist! Of course that&rsquo;s all as it should be and it would be surprising if it were not so, yet it is strange in reality....</p></div> </div>
