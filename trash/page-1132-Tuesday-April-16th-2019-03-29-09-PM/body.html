I&rsquo;ll go directly and you may be sure I won&rsquo;t be in your way.&rdquo;</p><p>Five minutes later Lebeziatnikov came in with Sonia. She came in very much surprised and overcome with shyness as usual. She was always shy in such circumstances and was always afraid of new people, she had been as a child and was even more so now.... Pyotr Petrovitch met her &ldquo;politely and affably,&rdquo; but with a certain shade of bantering familiarity which in his opinion was suitable for a man of his respectability and weight in dealing with a creature so young and so interesting as she. He hastened to &ldquo;reassure&rdquo; her and made her sit down facing him at the table.</p></div> </div>
