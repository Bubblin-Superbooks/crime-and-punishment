Well, he&rsquo;s simply a genius of hypocrisy and resourcefulness in disarming the suspicions of the lawyers&mdash;so there&rsquo;s nothing much to wonder at, I suppose! Of course people like that are always possible. And the fact that he couldn&rsquo;t keep up the character, but confessed, makes him easier to believe in. But what a fool I was! I was frantic on their side!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
