<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> As for a hat&mdash;well, what does a hat matter? I can buy a hat as easily as I can a bun; but what&rsquo;s under the hat, what the hat covers, I can&rsquo;t buy that! I was even meaning to come and apologise to you, but thought maybe you&rsquo;d... But I am forgetting to ask you, is there anything you want really? I hear your family have come?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Yes, my mother and sister.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve even had the honour and happiness of meeting your sister&mdash;a highly cultivated and charming person. I confess I was sorry I got so hot with you. There it is! But as for my looking suspiciously at your fainting fit&mdash;that affair has been cleared up splendidly! Bigotry and fanaticism! I understand your indignation. Perhaps you are changing your lodging on account of your family&rsquo;s arriving?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
