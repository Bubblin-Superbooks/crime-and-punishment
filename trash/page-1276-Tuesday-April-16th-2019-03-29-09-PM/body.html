<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ach!&rdquo; Sonia cried in terror.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, why do you cry out? You want me to go to Siberia and now you are frightened? But let me tell you: I shall not give myself up. I shall make a struggle for it and they won&rsquo;t do anything to me. They&rsquo;ve no real evidence. Yesterday I was in great danger and believed I was lost; but to-day things are going better. All the facts they know can be explained two ways, that&rsquo;s to say I can turn their accusations to my credit, do you understand? And I shall, for I&rsquo;ve learnt my lesson. But they will certainly arrest me. If it had not been for something that happened, they would have done so to-day for certain; perhaps even now they will arrest me to-day.... But that&rsquo;s no matter, Sonia; they&rsquo;ll let me out again... for there isn&rsquo;t any real proof against me, and there won&rsquo;t be, I give you my word for it.</p></div> </div>
