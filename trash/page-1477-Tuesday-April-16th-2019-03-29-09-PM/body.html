<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Allow me to inquire whether she is at home.... She is not. How unfortunate! But I know she may come quite soon. If she&rsquo;s gone out, it can only be to see a lady about the orphans. Their mother is dead.... I&rsquo;ve been meddling and making arrangements for them. If Sofya Semyonovna does not come back in ten minutes, I will send her to you, to-day if you like. This is my flat. These are my two rooms. Madame Resslich, my landlady, has the next room. Now, look this way. I will show you my chief piece of evidence: this door from my bedroom leads into two perfectly empty rooms, which are to let. Here they are... You must look into them with some attention.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
