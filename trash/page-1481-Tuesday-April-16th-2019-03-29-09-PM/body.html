<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Speak! But let me warn you that I don&rsquo;t believe you! I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo;</p><p>Dounia said this, speaking hurriedly, and for an instant the colour rushed to her face.</p><p>&ldquo;If you didn&rsquo;t believe it, how could you risk coming alone to my rooms? Why have you come? Simply from curiosity?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t torment me. Speak, speak!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no denying that you are a brave girl. Upon my word, I thought you would have asked Mr. Razumihin to escort you here. But he was not with you nor anywhere near. I was on the look-out. It&rsquo;s spirited of you, it proves you wanted to spare Rodion Romanovitch. But everything is divine in you.... About your brother, what am I to say to you? You&rsquo;ve just seen him yourself. What did you think of him?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
