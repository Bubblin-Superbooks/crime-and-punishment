I think it a very satisfactory one, ha-ha! They go to the Academy, study anatomy. If I fall ill, am I to send for a young lady to treat me? What do you say? Ha-ha!&rdquo; Ilya Petrovitch laughed, quite pleased with his own wit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an immoderate zeal for education, but once you&rsquo;re educated, that&rsquo;s enough. Why abuse it? Why insult honourable people, as that scoundrel Zametov does? Why did he insult me, I ask you? Look at these suicides, too, how common they are, you can&rsquo;t fancy! People spend their last halfpenny and kill themselves, boys and girls and old people. Only this morning we heard about a gentleman who had just come to town. Nil Pavlitch, I say, what was the name of that gentleman who shot himself?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
