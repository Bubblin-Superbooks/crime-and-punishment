<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Luzhin turned pale.</p><p>&ldquo;What lies!&rdquo; he cried impudently, &ldquo;why, how could you, standing by the window, see the note? You fancied it with your short-sighted eyes. You are raving!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t fancy it. And though I was standing some way off, I saw it all. And though it certainly would be hard to distinguish a note from the window&mdash;that&rsquo;s true&mdash;I knew for certain that it was a hundred-rouble note, because, when you were going to give Sofya Semyonovna ten roubles, you took up from the table a hundred-rouble note (I saw it because I was standing near then, and an idea struck me at once, so that I did not forget you had it in your hand). You folded it and kept it in your hand all the time.</p></div> </div>
