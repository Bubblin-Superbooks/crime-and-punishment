I must see her at once. Perhaps she...&rdquo;</p><p>Avdotya Romanovna could not finish. Her breath literally failed her.</p><p>&ldquo;Sofya Semyonovna will not be back till night, at least I believe not. She was to have been back at once, but if not, then she will not be in till quite late.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, then you are lying! I see... you were lying... lying all the time.... I don&rsquo;t believe you! I don&rsquo;t believe you!&rdquo; cried Dounia, completely losing her head.</p></div> </div>
