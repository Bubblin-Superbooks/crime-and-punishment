<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> You have long needed a change of air. Suffering, too, is a good thing. Suffer! Maybe Nikolay is right in wanting to suffer. I know you don&rsquo;t believe in it&mdash;but don&rsquo;t be over-wise; fling yourself straight into life, without deliberation; don&rsquo;t be afraid&mdash;the flood will bear you to the bank and set you safe on your feet again. What bank? How can I tell? I only believe that you have long life before you. I know that you take all my words now for a set speech prepared beforehand, but maybe you will remember them after. They may be of use some time. That&rsquo;s why I speak. It&rsquo;s as well that you only killed the old woman. If you&rsquo;d invented another theory you might perhaps have done something a thousand times more hideous. You ought to thank God, perhaps. How do you know? Perhaps God is saving you for something.</p></div> </div>
