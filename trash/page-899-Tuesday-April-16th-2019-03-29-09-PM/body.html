He stood up and took his hat. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t quite intend to disturb you and I came here without reckoning on it... though I was very much struck by your face this morning.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Where did you see me this morning?&rdquo; Raskolnikov asked uneasily.</p><p>&ldquo;I saw you by chance.... I kept fancying there is something about you like me.... But don&rsquo;t be uneasy. I am not intrusive; I used to get on all right with card-sharpers, and I never bored Prince Svirbey, a great personage who is a distant relation of mine, and I could write about Raphael&rsquo;s Madonna in Madam Prilukov&rsquo;s album, and I never left Marfa Petrovna&rsquo;s side for seven years, and I used to stay the night at Viazemsky&rsquo;</p></div> </div>
