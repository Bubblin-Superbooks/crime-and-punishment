<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> A book, a pen behind your ear, a learned research&mdash;that&rsquo;s where your spirit soars! I am the same way myself.... Have you read Livingstone&rsquo;s Travels?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, I have. There are a great many Nihilists about nowadays, you know, and indeed it is not to be wondered at. What sort of days are they? I ask you. But we thought... you are not a Nihilist of course? Answer me openly, openly!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;N-no...&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Believe me, you can speak openly to me as you would to yourself! Official duty is one thing but... you are thinking I meant to say friendship is quite another? No, you&rsquo;re wrong! It&rsquo;s not friendship, but the feeling of a man and a citizen, the feeling of humanity and of love for the Almighty. I may be an official, but I am always bound to feel myself a man and a citizen....</p></div> </div>
