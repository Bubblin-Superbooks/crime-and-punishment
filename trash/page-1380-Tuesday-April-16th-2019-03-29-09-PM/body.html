You see yourself that I have not come to chase and capture you like a hare. Whether you confess it or not is nothing to me now; for myself, I am convinced without it.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;If so, what did you come for?&rdquo; Raskolnikov asked irritably. &ldquo;I ask you the same question again: if you consider me guilty, why don&rsquo;t you take me to prison?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s your question!
