He went to church and prayed with the others. A quarrel broke out one day, he did not know how. All fell on him at once in a fury.</p><p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an infidel! You don&rsquo;t believe in God,&rdquo; they shouted. &ldquo;You ought to be killed.&rdquo;</p><p>He had never talked to them about God nor his belief, but they wanted to kill him as an infidel. He said nothing. One of the prisoners rushed at him in a perfect frenzy. Raskolnikov awaited him calmly and silently; his eyebrows did not quiver, his face did not flinch.
