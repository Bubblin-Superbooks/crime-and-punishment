The girl at once broke off and stood waiting respectfully. She had sung her guttural rhymes, too, with a serious and respectful expression in her face.</p><p>&ldquo;Hey, Philip, a glass!&rdquo; shouted Svidrigaïlov.</p><p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t drink anything,&rdquo; said Raskolnikov.</p><p>&ldquo;As you like, I didn&rsquo;t mean it for you. Drink, Katia! I don&rsquo;t want anything more to-day, you can go.&rdquo; He poured her out a full glass, and laid down a yellow note.</p><p>Katia drank off her glass of wine, as women do, without putting it down, in twenty gulps, took the note and kissed Svidrigaïlov&rsquo;s hand, which he allowed quite seriously. She went out of the room and the boy trailed after her with the organ. Both had been brought in from the street.</p></div> </div>
