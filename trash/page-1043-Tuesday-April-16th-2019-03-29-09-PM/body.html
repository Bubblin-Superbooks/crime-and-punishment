<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It may be so with a simple peasant, but with one of our sort, an intelligent man cultivated on a certain side, it&rsquo;s a dead certainty. For, my dear fellow, it&rsquo;s a very important matter to know on what side a man is cultivated. And then there are nerves, there are nerves, you have overlooked them! Why, they are all sick, nervous and irritable!... And then how they all suffer from spleen! That I assure you is a regular gold-mine for us. And it&rsquo;s no anxiety to me, his running about the town free! Let him, let him walk about for a bit! I know well enough that I&rsquo;ve caught him and that he won&rsquo;t escape me. Where could he escape to, he-he? Abroad, perhaps? A Pole will escape abroad, but not here, especially as I am watching and have taken measures. Will he escape into the depths of the country perhaps? But you know, peasants live there, real rude Russian peasants.</p></div> </div>
