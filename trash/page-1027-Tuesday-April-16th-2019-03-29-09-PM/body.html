<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, yes! There&rsquo;s no hurry, there&rsquo;s no hurry,&rdquo; muttered Porfiry Petrovitch, moving to and fro about the table without any apparent aim, as it were making dashes towards the window, the bureau and the table, at one moment avoiding Raskolnikov&rsquo;s suspicious glance, then again standing still and looking him straight in the face.</p><p>His fat round little figure looked very strange, like a ball rolling from one side to the other and rebounding back.</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve plenty of time. Do you smoke? have you your own? Here, a cigarette!&rdquo; he went on, offering his visitor a cigarette. &ldquo;You know I am receiving you here, but my own quarters are through there, you know, my government quarters. But I am living outside for the time, I had to have some repairs done here. It&rsquo;s almost finished now.... Government quarters, you know, are a capital thing. Eh, what do you think?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
