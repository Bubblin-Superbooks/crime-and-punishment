<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long story, Avdotya Romanovna. Here&rsquo;s... how shall I tell you?&mdash;A theory of a sort, the same one by which I for instance consider that a single misdeed is permissible if the principal aim is right, a solitary wrongdoing and hundreds of good deeds! It&rsquo;s galling too, of course, for a young man of gifts and overweening pride to know that if he had, for instance, a paltry three thousand, his whole career, his whole future would be differently shaped and yet not to have that three thousand. Add to that, nervous irritability from hunger, from lodging in a hole, from rags, from a vivid sense of the charm of his social position and his sister&rsquo;s and mother&rsquo;s position too. Above all, vanity, pride and vanity, though goodness knows he may have good qualities too.... I am not blaming him, please don&rsquo;t think it; besides, it&rsquo;s not my business.</p></div> </div>
