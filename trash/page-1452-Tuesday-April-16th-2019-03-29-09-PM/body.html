<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> I told them I was in a hurry owing to domestic circumstances, and the next day, that is the day before yesterday, we were betrothed. When I go now I take her on my knee at once and keep her there.... Well, she flushes like a sunset and I kiss her every minute. Her mamma of course impresses on her that this is her husband and that this must be so. It&rsquo;s simply delicious! The present betrothed condition is perhaps better than marriage. Here you have what is called la nature et la vérité, ha-ha! I&rsquo;ve talked to her twice, she is far from a fool. Sometimes she steals a look at me that positively scorches me. Her face is like Raphael&rsquo;s Madonna. You know, the Sistine Madonna&rsquo;s face has something fantastic in it, the face of mournful religious ecstasy. Haven&rsquo;t you noticed it? Well, she&rsquo;s something in that line.</p></div> </div>
