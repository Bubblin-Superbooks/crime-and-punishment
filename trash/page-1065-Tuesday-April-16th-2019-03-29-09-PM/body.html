<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> No, I should first have disarmed your suspicions and not let you see I knew of that fact, should have diverted your attention and suddenly have dealt you a knock-down blow (your expression) saying: &lsquo;And what were you doing, sir, pray, at ten or nearly eleven at the murdered woman&rsquo;s flat and why did you ring the bell and why did you ask about blood? And why did you invite the porters to go with you to the police station, to the lieutenant?&rsquo; That&rsquo;s how I ought to have acted if I had a grain of suspicion of you. I ought to have taken your evidence in due form, searched your lodging and perhaps have arrested you, too... so I have no suspicion of you, since I have not done that! But you can&rsquo;t look at it normally and you see nothing, I say again.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
