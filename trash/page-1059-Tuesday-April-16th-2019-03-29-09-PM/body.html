<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Thanks to the Court of Appeal! Tut-tut-tut! Why, my dear fellow, you may drive yourself into delirium if you have the impulse to work upon your nerves, to go ringing bells at night and asking about blood! I&rsquo;ve studied all this morbid psychology in my practice. A man is sometimes tempted to jump out of a window or from a belfry. Just the same with bell-ringing.... It&rsquo;s all illness, Rodion Romanovitch! You have begun to neglect your illness. You should consult an experienced doctor, what&rsquo;s the good of that fat fellow? You are lightheaded! You were delirious when you did all this!&rdquo;</p><p>For a moment Raskolnikov felt everything going round.</p></div> </div>
