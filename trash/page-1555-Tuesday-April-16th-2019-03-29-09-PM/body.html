<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Rodya, Rodya, what is the matter? How can you ask me such a question? Why, who will tell me anything about you? Besides, I shouldn&rsquo;t believe anyone, I should refuse to listen.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to assure you that I&rsquo;ve always loved you and I am glad that we are alone, even glad Dounia is out,&rdquo; he went on with the same impulse. &ldquo;I have come to tell you that though you will be unhappy, you must believe that your son loves you now more than himself, and that all you thought about me, that I was cruel and didn&rsquo;t care about you, was all a mistake. I shall never cease to love you.... Well, that&rsquo;s enough: I thought I must do this and begin with this....&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
