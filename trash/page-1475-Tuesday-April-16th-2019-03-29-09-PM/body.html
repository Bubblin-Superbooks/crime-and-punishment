<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Have you prepared Sofya Semyonovna?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;No, I have not said a word to her and am not quite certain whether she is at home now. But most likely she is. She has buried her stepmother to-day: she is not likely to go visiting on such a day. For the time I don&rsquo;t want to speak to anyone about it and I half regret having spoken to you. The slightest indiscretion is as bad as betrayal in a thing like this. I live there in that house, we are coming to it. That&rsquo;s the porter of our house&mdash;he knows me very well; you see, he&rsquo;s bowing; he sees I&rsquo;m coming with a lady and no doubt he has noticed your face already and you will be glad of that if you are afraid of me and suspicious. Excuse my putting things so coarsely. I haven&rsquo;t a flat to myself; Sofya Semyonovna&rsquo;s room is next to mine&mdash;she lodges in the next flat. The whole floor is let out in lodgings. Why are you frightened like a child? Am I really so terrible?&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
