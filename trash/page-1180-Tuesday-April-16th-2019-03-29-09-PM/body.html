<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Katerina Ivanovna at once &ldquo;set her down,&rdquo; saying that it was a lie to say she wished her good, because only yesterday when her dead husband was lying on the table, she had worried her about the lodgings. To this Amalia Ivanovna very appropriately observed that she had invited those ladies, but &ldquo;those ladies had not come, because those ladies are ladies and cannot come to a lady who is not a lady.&rdquo; Katerina Ivanovna at once pointed out to her, that as she was a slut she could not judge what made one really a lady. Amalia Ivanovna at once declared that her &ldquo;Vater aus Berlin was a very, very important man, and both hands in pockets went, and always used to say: &lsquo;Poof! poof!&rsquo;&rdquo; and she leapt up from the table to represent her father, sticking her hands in her pockets, puffing her cheeks, and uttering vague sounds resembling &ldquo;poof! poof!&rdquo; amid loud laughter from all the lodgers, who purposely encouraged Amalia Ivanovna, hoping for a fight.</p></div> </div>
