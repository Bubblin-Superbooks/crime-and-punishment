<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Understand that, if you are not reconciled, I must choose between you&mdash;it must be either you or he. That is how the question rests on your side and on his. I don&rsquo;t want to be mistaken in my choice, and I must not be. For your sake I must break off with my brother, for my brother&rsquo;s sake I must break off with you. I can find out for certain now whether he is a brother to me, and I want to know it; and of you, whether I am dear to you, whether you esteem me, whether you are the husband for me.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Avdotya Romanovna,&rdquo; Luzhin declared huffily, &ldquo;your words are of too much consequence to me; I will say more, they are offensive in view of the position I have the honour to occupy in relation to you.</p></div> </div>
