And it&rsquo;s not a question of self-sacrifice, it&rsquo;s simply work, honourable, useful work which is as good as any other and much better than the work of a Raphael and a Pushkin, because it is more useful.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And more honourable, more honourable, he-he-he!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;more honourable&rsquo;? I don&rsquo;t understand such expressions to describe human activity. &lsquo;More honourable,&rsquo; &lsquo;nobler&rsquo;&mdash;all those are old-fashioned prejudices which I reject. Everything which is of use to mankind is honourable. I only understand one word: useful! You can snigger as much as you like, but that&rsquo;s so!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
