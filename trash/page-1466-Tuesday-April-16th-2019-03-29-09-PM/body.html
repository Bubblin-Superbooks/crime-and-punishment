<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No matter, I&rsquo;ll come all the same.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As you like, it&rsquo;s nothing to me, but I won&rsquo;t come with you; here we are at home. By the way, I am convinced that you regard me with suspicion just because I have shown such delicacy and have not so far troubled you with questions... you understand? It struck you as extraordinary; I don&rsquo;t mind betting it&rsquo;s that. Well, it teaches one to show delicacy!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;And to listen at doors!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s it, is it?&rdquo; laughed Svidriga√Ølov. &ldquo;Yes, I should have been surprised if you had let that pass after all that has happened. Ha-ha! Though I did understand something of the pranks you had been up to and were telling Sofya Semyonovna about, what was the meaning of it? Perhaps I am quite behind the times and can&rsquo;t understand. For goodness&rsquo; sake, explain it, my dear boy. Expound the latest theories!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
