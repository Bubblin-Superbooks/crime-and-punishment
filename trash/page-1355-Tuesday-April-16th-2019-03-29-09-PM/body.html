<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;Ah these cigarettes!&rdquo; Porfiry Petrovitch ejaculated at last, having lighted one. &ldquo;They are pernicious, positively pernicious, and yet I can&rsquo;t give them up! I cough, I begin to have tickling in my throat and a difficulty in breathing. You know I am a coward, I went lately to Dr. B&mdash;&mdash;n; he always gives at least half an hour to each patient. He positively laughed looking at me; he sounded me: &lsquo;Tobacco&rsquo;s bad for you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;your lungs are affected.&rsquo; But how am I to give it up? What is there to take its place? I don&rsquo;t drink, that&rsquo;s the mischief, he-he-he, that I don&rsquo;t. Everything is relative, Rodion Romanovitch, everything is relative!&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
