<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>&ldquo;No, not from me, but I knew he went to you and why he went,&rdquo; Raskolnikov answered sharply.</p><p>&ldquo;You knew?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I knew. What of it?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Why this, Rodion Romanovitch, that I know more than that about you; I know about everything. I know how you went to take a flat at night when it was dark and how you rang the bell and asked about the blood, so that the workmen and the porter did not know what to make of it. Yes, I understand your state of mind at that time... but you&rsquo;ll drive yourself mad like that, upon my word! You&rsquo;ll lose your head! You&rsquo;re full of generous indignation at the wrongs you&rsquo;ve received, first from destiny, and then from the police officers, and so you rush from one thing to another to force them to speak out and make an end of it all, because you are sick of all this suspicion and foolishness.</p></div> </div>
