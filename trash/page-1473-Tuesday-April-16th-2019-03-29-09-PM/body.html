She stole by her brother and went up to Svidrigaïlov.</p><p>&ldquo;Let us make haste away,&rdquo; Svidrigaïlov whispered to her, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want Rodion Romanovitch to know of our meeting. I must tell you I&rsquo;ve been sitting with him in the restaurant close by, where he looked me up and I had great difficulty in getting rid of him. He has somehow heard of my letter to you and suspects something. It wasn&rsquo;t you who told him, of course, but if not you, who then?&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve turned the corner now,&rdquo; Dounia interrupted, &ldquo;and my brother won&rsquo;t see us. I have to tell you that I am going no further with you. Speak to me here. You can tell it all in the street.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
