His tone seemed strange to her; a cold shiver ran over her, but in a moment she guessed that the tone and the words were a mask. He spoke to her looking away, as though to avoid meeting her eyes.</p><p>&ldquo;You see, Sonia, I&rsquo;ve decided that it will be better so. There is one fact.... But it&rsquo;s a long story and there&rsquo;s no need to discuss it. But do you know what angers me? It annoys me that all those stupid brutish faces will be gaping at me directly, pestering me with their stupid questions, which I shall have to answer&mdash;they&rsquo;ll point their fingers at me....
