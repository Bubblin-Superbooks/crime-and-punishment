<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Of course, I am sure that Dounia has far too much sense, and besides she loves you and me... but I don&rsquo;t know what it will all lead to. You&rsquo;ve made me so happy by coming now, Rodya, but she has missed you by going out; when she comes in I&rsquo;ll tell her: &lsquo;Your brother came in while you were out. Where have you been all this time?&rsquo; You mustn&rsquo;t spoil me, Rodya, you know; come when you can, but if you can&rsquo;t, it doesn&rsquo;t matter, I can wait. I shall know, anyway, that you are fond of me, that will be enough for me. I shall read what you write, I shall hear about you from everyone, and sometimes you&rsquo;ll come yourself to see me. What could be better? Here you&rsquo;ve come now to comfort your mother, I see that.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
