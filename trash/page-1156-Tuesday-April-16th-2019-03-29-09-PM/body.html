<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> It must be noted that when Katerina Ivanovna exalted anyone&rsquo;s connections and fortune, it was without any ulterior motive, quite disinterestedly, for the mere pleasure of adding to the consequence of the person praised. Probably &ldquo;taking his cue&rdquo; from Luzhin, &ldquo;that contemptible wretch Lebeziatnikov had not turned up either. What did he fancy himself? He was only asked out of kindness and because he was sharing the same room with Pyotr Petrovitch and was a friend of his, so that it would have been awkward not to invite him.&rdquo;</p><p>Among those who failed to appear were &ldquo;the genteel lady and her old-maidish daughter,&rdquo; who had only been lodgers in the house for the last fortnight, but had several times complained of the noise and uproar in Katerina Ivanovna&rsquo;s room, especially when Marmeladov had come back drunk.</p></div> </div>
