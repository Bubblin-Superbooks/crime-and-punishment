Quite another question! You simply despise her. Seeing a fact which you mistakenly consider deserving of contempt, you refuse to take a humane view of a fellow creature. You don&rsquo;t know what a character she is! I am only sorry that of late she has quite given up reading and borrowing books. I used to lend them to her.</p></div> </div>
