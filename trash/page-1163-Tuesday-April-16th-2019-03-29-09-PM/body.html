Ha-ha-ha!&rdquo; She laughed turning to Raskolnikov, and again nodding towards the landlady, in high glee at her sally. &ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t understand, she didn&rsquo;t understand again! Look how she sits with her mouth open! An owl, a real owl! An owl in new ribbons, ha-ha-ha!&rdquo;</p><p>Here her laugh turned again to an insufferable fit of coughing that lasted five minutes. Drops of perspiration stood out on her forehead and her handkerchief was stained with blood. She showed Raskolnikov the blood in silence, and as soon as she could get her breath began whispering to him again with extreme animation and a hectic flush on her cheeks.</p></div> </div>
