<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> And what sort of atmosphere would you have? If you ran away, you&rsquo;d come back to yourself. You can&rsquo;t get on without us. And if I put you in prison&mdash;say you&rsquo;ve been there a month, or two, or three&mdash;remember my word, you&rsquo;ll confess of yourself and perhaps to your own surprise. You won&rsquo;t know an hour beforehand that you are coming with a confession. I am convinced that you will decide, &lsquo;to take your suffering.&rsquo; You don&rsquo;t believe my words now, but you&rsquo;ll come to it of yourself. For suffering, Rodion Romanovitch, is a great thing. Never mind my having grown fat, I know all the same. Don&rsquo;t laugh at it, there&rsquo;s an idea in suffering, Nikolay is right. No, you won&rsquo;t run away, Rodion Romanovitch.&rdquo;</p></div> </div>
