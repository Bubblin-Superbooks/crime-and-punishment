This was investigated and fairly well confirmed by many witnesses. These facts made an impression in his favour.</p><p>And in the end the criminal was, in consideration of extenuating circumstances, condemned to penal servitude in the second class for a term of eight years only.</p><p>At the very beginning of the trial Raskolnikov&rsquo;s mother fell ill. Dounia and Razumihin found it possible to get her out of Petersburg during the trial. Razumihin chose a town on the railway not far from Petersburg, so as to be able to follow every step of the trial and at the same time to see Avdotya Romanovna as often as possible.</p></div> </div>
